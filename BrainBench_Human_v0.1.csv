https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2043-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context). How does the brain's functional architecture enable sensory and mnemonic representations to closely interface while also avoiding sensory-mnemonic interference? Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality and fMRI. Using virtual reality, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a single FOV to a city street. We used individualized, within-subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiment 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that were modulated by the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.","To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context).

A previous study revealed that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)-parabrachial nucleus (PBN) pathway is involved in pain regulation. The same pathway might also control itch. To test this possibility, prodynorphin (Pdyn)-Cre mice were used to optogenetically manipulate Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections. We found that optogenetic stimulation of Pdyn+ amygdala neurons or Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections inhibited histamine-evoked and chloroquine-evoked scratching. The number of Fos-positive neurons in the PBN increased following intradermal injection of chloroquine. Optogenetic stimulation of Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections suppressed the increase in Fos expression in the PBN. Optogenetic stimulation of Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections increased thermal and mechanical thresholds without affecting anxiety-like behavior. These results highlight the importance of dynorphinergic projections from the central amygdala to the parabrachial nucleus in the regulation of itch signaling.","The amygdala plays a key role in the processing of itch and pain signals as well as emotion.

Analysis of 51,586 endothelial cells revealed unique gene expression patterns across the five regions in non-AD donors. Alzheimer's brain endothelial cells were characterized by upregulated protein folding genes and distinct transcriptomic differences in response to amyloid Î² plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This dataset demonstrates previously unrecognized regional heterogeneity in the endothelial cell transcriptome in both aged non-AD and AD brain.","Vascular endothelial cells play an important role in maintaining brain health, but their contribution to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is obscured by limited understanding of the cellular heterogeneity in normal aged brain and in disease.

We evaluate these hypotheses by analyzing human hippocampal recordings captured as 162 neurosurgical patients (n = 86 female) performed a free recall task. Using the Irregular-Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis (IRASA) to separate broad and narrowband components of the field potential, we show that (1) broadband and narrowband components of theta exhibit opposite effects, with broadband signals decreasing and narrowband theta increasing during successful encoding; (2) whereas low-frequency theta oscillations increase before successful recall, higher-frequency theta and alpha oscillations decrease, masking the positive effect of theta when aggregating across the full band; and (3) the effects of theta on memory encoding and retrieval do not differ between reference schemes that accentuate local signals (bipolar) and those that aggregate signals globally (whole-brain average). In line with computational models that ascribe a fundamental role for hippocampal theta in memory, our large-scale study of human hippocampal recordings shows that 3â4 Hz theta oscillations reliably increase during successful memory encoding and before spontaneous recall of previously studied items.","Computational models of rodent physiology implicate hippocampal theta as a key modulator of learning and memory (BuzsÃ¡ki and Moser, 2013; Lisman and Jensen, 2013), yet human hippocampal recordings have shown divergent theta correlates of memory formation.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0371-22.2022,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Humans can label and categorize objects in a visual scene with high accuracy and speed, a capacity well characterized with studies using static images. However, motion is another cue that could be used by the visual system to classify objects. To determine how motion-defined object category information is processed by the brain in the absence of luminance-defined form information, we created a novel stimulus set of âobject kinematogramsâ to isolate motion-defined signals from other sources of visual information. Object kinematograms were generated by extracting motion information from videos of 6 object categories and applying the motion to limited-lifetime random dot patterns. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 15, 40% women), we investigated whether category information from the object kinematograms could be decoded within the occipitotemporal and parietal cortex and evaluated whether the information overlapped with category responses to static images from the original videos. We decoded object category for both stimulus formats in all higher-order regions of interest (ROIs). More posterior occipitotemporal and ventral regions showed higher accuracy in the static condition, while more anterior occipitotemporal and dorsal regions showed higher accuracy in the dynamic condition. Further, decoding across the two stimulus formats was possible in all regions. These results demonstrate that motion cues can elicit widespread and robust category responses on par with those elicited by static luminance cues, even in ventral regions of visual cortex that have traditionally been associated with primarily image-defined form processing.","Humans can label and categorize objects in a visual scene with high accuracy and speed, a capacity well characterized with studies using static images.

Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be controlled based on the minimization of the control cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Despite its great potential, the current control paradigm in neuroscience uses a deterministic framework and is therefore unable to consider stochasticity, severely limiting its application to neural data. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a novel framework for the evaluation of control costs based on a linear stochastic model. Following our previous work, we quantified the optimal control cost as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence between the uncontrolled and controlled processes. In the linear model, we established an analytical expression for minimal cost and showed that we can decompose it into the cost for controlling the mean and covariance of brain activity. To evaluate the utility of our novel framework, we examined the significant brain regions in the optimal control of transitions from the resting state to seven cognitive task states in human whole-brain imaging data of either sex. We found that, in realizing the different transitions, the lower visual areas commonly played a significant role in controlling the means, while the posterior cingulate cortex commonly played a significant role in controlling the covariances.","The brain is a system that performs numerous functions by controlling its states.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0148-22.2022,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging. Using fMRI, fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and impairment following focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience data, a large, population-based cohort of healthy males and females across the adult lifespan. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localize the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodeled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. An additional moderating role of the variety of nonphysical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.","Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging.

The neutral information was the association that forms between an auditory stimulus and a visual stimulus (labeled S2 and S1) across their pairings in sensory preconditioning. We show that, when the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a shocked context exposure, the danger shifts consolidation of the S2-S1 association from the PRh to the BLA; and does so by interacting with processes involved in encoding of the S2-S1 pairings. Specifically, we show that the initial S2-S1 pairing in sensory preconditioning is encoded in the BLA and not the PRh; whereas the later S2-S1 pairings are encoded in the PRh and not the BLA. When the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a context alone exposure, the BLA-dependent trace of the early S2-S1 pairings decays and the PRh-dependent trace of the later S2-S1 pairings is consolidated in memory. However, when the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a shocked context exposure, the PRh-dependent trace of the later S2-S1 pairings is suppressed and the BLA-dependent trace of the initial S2-S1 pairing is consolidated in memory.

However, when the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a shocked context exposure, the BLA-dependent trace of the later S2-S1 pairings is suppressed and the PRh-dependent trace of the initial S2-S1 pairing is consolidated in memory. These findings are discussed with respect to mutually inhibitory interactions between the PRh and BLA, and the way that these regions support memory in other protocols, including recognition memory in people.","This study examined the effect of danger on consolidation of neutral information in two regions of the rat (male and female) medial temporal lobe: the perirhinal cortex (PRh) and basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). The neutral information was the association that forms between an auditory stimulus and a visual stimulus (labeled S2 and S1) across their pairings in sensory preconditioning. We show that, when the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a shocked context exposure, the danger shifts consolidation of the S2-S1 association from the [[PRh, BLA]] to the [[BLA, PRh]]; and does so by interacting with processes involved in encoding of the S2-S1 pairings. Specifically, we show that the initial S2-S1 pairing in sensory preconditioning is encoded in the [[BLA, PRh]] and not the [[PRh, BLA]]; whereas the later S2-S1 pairings are encoded in the [[PRh, BLA]] and not the [[BLA, PRh]]. When the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a context alone exposure, the [[BLA-dependent, PRh-dependent]] trace of the early S2-S1 pairings decays and the [[PRh-dependent, BLA-dependent]] trace of the later S2-S1 pairings is consolidated in memory.

However, how the thalamic structure and function develops at macroscopic and microscopic scales during the perinatal period development is not yet well characterized. Here, we used multishell high-angular resolution diffusion MRI of 144 preterm-born and full-term infants in both sexes scanned at 32â44 postmenstrual weeks (PMWs) from the Developing Human Connectome Project database to investigate the thalamic development in morphology, microstructure, associated connectivity, and subnucleus division. We found evident anatomic expansion and linear increases of fiber integrity in the lateral side of thalamus compared with the medial part. The tractography results indicated that thalamic connection to the frontal cortex developed later than the other thalamocortical connections (parieto-occipital, motor, somatosensory, and temporal). Using a connectivity-based segmentation strategy, we revealed that functional partitions of thalamic subdivisions were formed at 32 PMWs or earlier, and the partition developed toward the adult pattern in a lateral-to-medial pattern. Collectively, these findings revealed faster development of the lateral thalamus than the central part as well as a posterior-to-anterior developmental gradient of thalamocortical connectivity from the third trimester to early infancy.","Thalamus is a critical component of the limbic system that is extensively involved in both basic and high-order brain functions.

In nature, stimuli lighter or darker than their local surround have different spatial properties and contrast distributions (Ratliff et al., 2010; Cooper and Norcia, 2015; Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al., 2021). Similarly, in human vision, we show that luminance contrast affects the perception of lights and darks differently. At high contrast, human subjects of both sexes locate dark stimuli faster and more accurately than light stimuli, which is consistent with a visual system dominated by the OFF pathway. However, at low contrast, they locate light stimuli faster and more accurately than dark stimuli, which is consistent with a visual system dominated by the ON pathway. Luminance contrast was strongly correlated with multiple ON/OFF dominance ratios estimated from light/dark ratios of performance errors, missed targets, or reaction times (RTs). All correlations could be demonstrated at multiple eccentricities of the central visual field with an ON-OFF perimetry test implemented in a head-mounted visual display. We conclude that high-contrast stimuli are processed faster and more accurately by OFF pathways than ON pathways. However, the OFF dominance shifts toward ON dominance when stimulus contrast decreases, as expected from the higher-contrast sensitivity of ON cortical pathways (Kremkow et al., 2014; Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al., 2021).

This revealed performance improvements on abstraction problems that were cued in REM, but not problems cued in SWS. Interestingly, the cue-related improvement was not significant until a follow-up retest 1 week after the manipulation, suggesting that REM may initiate a sequence of plasticity events that requires more time to be implemented.

By exploiting numerous behavioral tasks in combination with time-limited optogenetic manipulations in male and female rats, we reveal that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons generate reinforcement through separable psychological processes.

This architecture is reminiscent of actorâcritic reinforcement learning models with VTA and SNc instructing the critic and actor, respectively.

Developmental auditory deprivation because of otitis media, a common childhood disease, produces long-standing changes in the central auditory system, even after the middle ear pathology is resolved. The effects of sound deprivation because of otitis media have been mostly studied in the ascending auditory system but remain to be examined in the descending pathway that runs from the auditory cortex to the cochlea via the brainstem. Alterations in the efferent neural system could be important because the descending olivocochlear pathway influences the neural representation of transient sounds in noise in the afferent auditory system and is thought to be involved in auditory learning. Here, we show that the inhibitory strength of the medial olivocochlear efferents is weaker in children with a documented history of otitis media relative to controls; both boys and girls were included in the study. In addition, children with otitis media history required a higher signal-to-noise ratio on a sentence-in-noise recognition task than controls to achieve the same criterion performance level.

It has been suggested that during reach planning this information is sent to the frontal cortex along a parieto-frontal pathway that connects V6Aâpremotor cortexâM1. A similar parieto-frontal network may also exist in the human brain, and we aimed here to study the timing of this functional connection during planning of a reaching movement toward different spatial positions. We probed the functional connectivity between human area V6A (hV6A) and the primary motor cortex (M1) using dual-site, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with a short (4 ms) and a longer (10 ms) interstimulus interval while healthy participants (18 men and 18 women) planned a visually-guided or a memory-guided reaching movement toward positions located at different depths and directions. We found that, when the stimulation over hV6A is sent 4 ms before the stimulation over M1, hV6A inhibits motor-evoked potentials during planning of either rightward or leftward reaching movements. No modulations were found when the stimulation over hV6A was sent 10 ms before the stimulation over M1, suggesting that only short medial parieto-frontal routes are active during reach planning. Moreover, the short route of hV6Aâpremotor cortexâM1 is active during reach planning irrespectively of the nature (visual or memory) of the reaching target. These results agree with previous neuroimaging studies and provide the first demonstration of the flow of inhibitory signals between hV6A and M1.","In the macaque monkey, area V6A, located in the medial posterior parietal cortex, contains cells that encode the spatial position of a reaching target.

Perplexingly, anatomy studies imply that corticofugal axons primarily target glutamatergic IC neurons while only sparsely innervating IC GABA neurons. Corticofugal inhibition of the IC may thus occur largely independently of feedforward activation of local GABA neurons. We shed light on this paradox using in vitro electrophysiology in acute IC slices from fluorescent reporter mice of either sex. Using optogenetic stimulation of corticofugal axons, we find that excitation evoked with single light flashes is indeed stronger in presumptive glutamatergic neurons compared with GABAergic neurons. However, many IC GABA neurons fire tonically at rest, such that sparse and weak excitation suffices to significantly increase their spike rates. Furthermore, a subset of glutamatergic IC neurons fire spikes during repetitive corticofugal activity, leading to polysynaptic excitation in IC GABA neurons owing to a dense intracollicular connectivity. Consequently, recurrent excitation amplifies corticofugal activity, drives spikes in IC GABA neurons, and generates substantial local inhibition in the IC.

Accordingly, the informational redundancy was greater among FSNs than PNs. Finally, optogenetic silencing of a subset of FSNs reduced spontaneous licking movement.

To fill this critical gap, this study unprecedentedly explored how genetic information differentially regulates the spatial topography of CT and SA in the neonatal brain by leveraging brain MR images from 202 twin neonates with minimal influence by the complicated postnatal environmental factors. We capitalized on infant-dedicated computational tools and a data-driven spectral clustering method to parcellate the cerebral cortex into a set of distinct regions purely according to the genetic correlation of cortical vertices in terms of CT and SA, respectively, and accordingly created the first genetically informed cortical parcellation maps of neonatal brains. Both genetic parcellation maps exhibit bilaterally symmetric and hierarchical patterns, but distinct spatial layouts. For CT, regions with closer genetic relationships demonstrate an anterior-posterior division, while for SA, regions with greater genetic proximity are typically within the same lobe. Certain genetically informed regions exhibit strong similarities between neonates and adults, with the most striking similarities in the medial surface in terms of SA, despite their overall substantial differences in genetic parcellation maps.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0815-23.2023,Cellular/Molecular,"Neurotransmission is shaped by extracellular pH. Alkalization enhances pH-sensitive transmitter release and receptor activation, whereas acidification inhibits these processes and can activate acid-sensitive conductances in the synaptic cleft. Previous work has shown that the synaptic cleft can either acidify because of synaptic vesicular release and/or alkalize because of Ca2+ extrusion by the plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA). The direction of change differs across synapse types. At the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the direction and magnitude of pH transients in the synaptic cleft during transmission remain ambiguous. We set out to elucidate the extracellular pH transients that occur at this cholinergic synapse under near-physiological conditions and identify their sources. We monitored pH-dependent changes in the synaptic cleft of the mouse levator auris longus using viral expression of the pseudoratiometric probe pHusion-Ex in the muscle. Using mice from both sexes, a significant and prolonged alkalization occurred when stimulating the connected nerve for 5 s at 50 Hz, which was dependent on postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ release. Sustained stimulation for a longer duration (20 s at 50 Hz) caused additional prolonged net acidification at the cleft. To investigate the mechanism underlying cleft alkalization, we used muscle-expressed GCaMP3 to monitor the contribution of postsynaptic Ca2+. Activity-induced liberation of intracellular Ca2+ in muscle positively correlated with alkalization of the synaptic cleft, whereas inhibiting PMCA significantly decreased the extent of cleft alkalization. Thus, cholinergic synapses of the mouse NMJ typically alkalize because of cytosolic Ca2+ liberated in muscle during activity, unless under highly strenuous conditions where acidification predominates.","Neurotransmission is shaped by extracellular pH. Alkalization enhances pH-sensitive transmitter release and receptor activation, whereas acidification inhibits these processes and can activate acid-sensitive conductances in the synaptic cleft. Previous work has shown that the synaptic cleft can either acidify because of synaptic vesicular release and/or alkalize because of Ca2+ extrusion by the plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA).

We also document biochemical complementation upon the fusion and fission of axonal mitochondria. Eliminating fusion by knocking down the neuronal mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2) reduced the rates of axonal mitochondrial trafficking and fusion, decreased the levels of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins, inhibited exocytosis, and impaired SV recruitment from the reserve pool during extended stimulation.

Human and animal studies demonstrate that ELS sensitizes individuals to subsequent stress. However, the neurobiological basis of such stress sensitization remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS-induced stress sensitization would be detectable at the level of neuronal ensembles, such that cells activated by ELS would be more reactive to adult stress. To test this, we leveraged transgenic mice to genetically tag, track, and manipulate experience-activated neurons. We found that in both male and female mice, ELS-activated neurons within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and to a lesser extent the medial prefrontal cortex, were preferentially reactivated by adult stress. To test whether reactivation of ELS-activated ensembles in the NAc contributes to stress hypersensitivity, we expressed hM4Dis receptor in control or ELS-activated neurons of pups and chemogenetically inhibited their activity during experience of adult stress. Inhibition of ELS-activated NAc neurons, but not control-tagged neurons, ameliorated social avoidance behavior following chronic social defeat stress in males. These data provide evidence that ELS-induced stress hypersensitivity is encoded at the level of corticolimbic neuronal ensembles.","Early-life stress (ELS) is one of the strongest lifetime risk factors for depression, anxiety, suicide, and other psychiatric disorders, particularly after facing additional stressful events later in life. Human and animal studies demonstrate that ELS sensitizes individuals to subsequent stress. However, the neurobiological basis of such stress sensitization remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS-induced stress sensitization would be detectable at the level of neuronal ensembles, such that cells activated by ELS would be more reactive to adult stress. To test this, we leveraged transgenic mice to genetically tag, track, and manipulate experience-activated neurons. We found that in both male and female mice, ELS-activated neurons within the hippocampus (CA1), and to a lesser extent the medial prefrontal cortex, were preferentially reactivated by adult stress. To test whether reactivation of ELS-activated ensembles in the CA1 contributes to stress hypersensitivity, we expressed hM3Dq receptor in control or ELS-activated neurons of pups and chemogenetically inhibited their activity during experience of adult stress.

In slices, most GPe neurons receive a continuous inhibitory synaptic barrage from 1 or 2 presynaptic GPe neurons. We measured the barrageâs effect on the firing rate and regularity of GPe neurons in male and female mice using perforated patch recordings. Silencing the firing of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GPe neurons by activating genetically expressed Archaerhodopsin current increased the firing rate and regularity of PVâ neurons. In contrast, silencing Npas1+ GPe neurons with Archaerhodopsin had insignificant effects on Npas1â neuron firing. Blocking spontaneous GABAergic synaptic input with gabazine reproduced the effects of silencing PV+ neuron firing on the firing rate and regularity of Npas1+ neurons and had similar effects on PV+ neuron firing. To simulate the barrage, we constructed conductance waveforms for dynamic clamp based on experimentally measured inhibitory postsynaptic conductance trains from 1 or 2 unitary local connections. The resulting inhibition replicated the effect on firing seen in the intact active network in the slice. We then increased the number of unitary inputs to match estimates of local network connectivity in vivo. As few as 5 unitary inputs produced large increases in firing irregularity. The firing rate was also reduced initially, but PV+ neurons exhibited a slow spike-frequency adaptation that partially restored the rate despite sustained inhibition. We conclude that the irregular firing pattern of GPe neurons in vivo is largely due to the ongoing local inhibitory synaptic barrage produced by the spontaneous firing of other GPe neurons.","Autonomously firing GABAergic neurons in the external globus pallidus (GPe) form a local synaptic network.

We found that paraventricular thalamus (PVT) neurons are robustly activated by acute restraining stress. Elevated PVT activity during probabilistic fear memory expression increases spiking in the dmPFC somatostatin neurons which in turn suppresses spiking of dmPFC parvalbumin (PV) neurons, and reverts the usual low fear responses associated with probabilistic fear memory to high fear. This dynamic and reversible modulation allows the original memory to be preserved and modulated during memory expression. In contrast, elevated PVT activity during fear conditioning impairs synaptic modifications in the dmPFC PV-neurons and abolishes the formation of probabilistic fear memory. Thus, PVT functions as a stress sensor to modulate the formation and expression of aversive memory by tuning inhibitory functions in the prefrontal circuitry.","The impact of stress on the formation and expression of memory is well studied, especially on the contributions of stress hormones.

A candidate explanation for this discrepancy is that delays and rewards are experienced in the moment in animal studies but tend to be hypothetical in human studies. We tested this hypothesis by examining the performance of amnesic participants with hippocampal lesions (one female, six males) on a novel experiential intertemporal choice task that used interesting photographs occluded by thick lines as rewards (Patt et al., 2021). Using a logistic function to model indifference points data, we compared performance to that on a classic intertemporal choice task with hypothetical outcomes. Participants with hippocampal lesions displayed impaired patterns of choices in the experiential task but not in the hypothetical task. Specifically, hippocampal lesions were associated with decreased amplitude of the delay-reward trade-off, with persistent choice of the delayed option despite delay increase. These results help explain previous discrepancies across animal and human studies, indicating that the hippocampus plays a critical role in temporal discounting when the outcomes of decisions are experienced in the moment, but not necessarily when they are hypothetical.","Temporal discounting (TD) represents the mental devaluation of rewards that are available after a delay.

Using a logistic function to model indifference points data, we compared performance to that on a classic intertemporal choice task with hypothetical outcomes. Participants with hippocampal lesions displayed impaired patterns of choices in the experiential task but not in the hypothetical task. Specifically, hippocampal lesions were associated with increased amplitude of the delay-reward trade-off, with persistent choice of the delayed option despite delay increase. These results help explain previous discrepancies across animal and human studies, indicating that the hippocampus plays a critical role in temporal discounting when the outcomes of decisions are experienced in the moment, but not necessarily when they are hypothetical.","Temporal discounting (TD) represents the mental devaluation of rewards that are available after a delay.

Here, we explored the effects of long-term cholinergic activity on the functional heterogeneity of CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices obtained from male rat brains. Application of agonists to either AChRs generally, or mAChRs specifically, induced robust increases in network activity in the low-gamma range. Prolonged AChR stimulation for 48 h uncovered a population of hyperadapting CA3 pyramidal neurons that typically fired a single, early action potential in response to current injection. Although these neurons were present in control networks, their proportions were dramatically increased following long-term cholinergic activity. Characterized by the presence of a strong M-current, the hyperadaptation phenotype was abolished by acute application of either M-channel antagonists or the reapplication of AChR agonists. We conclude that long-term mAChR activation modulates the intrinsic excitability of a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells, uncovering a highly plastic cohort of neurons that are sensitive to chronic ACh modulation. Our findings provide evidence for the activity-dependent plasticity of functional heterogeneity in the hippocampus.","The functional heterogeneity of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons has emerged as a key aspect of circuit function.

Nevertheless, synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells remains to be characterized. Here, we have used mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of either sex, in which the entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate granule cell (GC; ECâGC) projection is present, and ECâGC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. By using cultures of wild-type mice, the properties of ECâGC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared, and differences in short-term plasticity were identified. As the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, we used tissue cultures of amyloid precursor protein (APP)âdeficient mice to examine the role of APP at this synapse. APP deficiency altered excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses, which was accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic APP deletion through the local injection of Cre-expressing adeno-associated viruses in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the neurotransmission efficacy at perforant path synapses.

Previous work has indicated that both the insular cortex and dynorphin (DYN)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) systems contribute to excessive alcohol use. More recently, we identified a microcircuit in the medial aspect of the insular cortex that signals through DYN/KOR. Here, we explored the role of insula DYN/KOR circuit components on alcohol intake in a long-term intermittent access (IA) procedure. Using a combination of conditional knock-out strategies and site-directed pharmacology, we discovered distinct and sex-specific roles for insula DYN and KOR in alcohol drinking and related behavior. Our findings show that insula DYN deletion blocked escalated consumption and decreased the overall intake of and preference for alcohol in male and female mice. This effect was specific to alcohol in male mice, as DYN deletion did not impact sucrose intake. Further, insula KOR antagonism reduced alcohol intake and preference during the early phase of IA in male mice only. Alcohol consumption was not affected by insula KOR knockout in either sex. In addition, we found that long-term IA decreased the intrinsic excitability of DYN and deep layer pyramidal neurons (DLPNs) in the insula of male mice. Excitatory synaptic transmission was also impacted by IA, as it drove an increase in excitatory synaptic drive in both DYN neurons and DLPNs.

Neural representation of USVs in the mouse primary auditory cortex (Au1) and its plasticity with experience has been largely studied with single-syllables or dyads, without using the predictability in USV sequences. Studies using playback of USV sequences have used randomly selected sequences from numerous possibilities. The current study uses mutual-information to obtain context-specific natural sequences (NSeqs) of USV syllables capturing the observed predictability in male USVs in different contexts of social interaction with females. Behavioral and physiological significance of NSeqs over random sequences (RSeqs) lacking predictability were examined. Female mice, never having the social experience of being exposed to males, showed higher selectivity for NSeqs behaviorally and at cellular levels probed by expression of immediate early gene c-fos in Au1. The Au1 supragranular single-units also showed higher selectivity to NSeqs over RSeqs. Social-experience-driven plasticity in encoding NSeqs and RSeqs in adult females was probed by examining neural selectivities to the same sequences before and after the above social experience.

We then studied Scn1aR1407X/+ (Dravet syndrome; DS) and Scn8aN1768D/+ (D/+) mice of both sexes, two models of SUDEP, and found that convulsive seizures caused a postictal decrease in ventilation and severely depressed the HCVR in a subset of animals. Those mice with severe postictal depression of the HCVR also exhibited transient postictal hypothermia. A combination of blunted HCVR and abnormal thermoregulation is known to occur with dysfunction of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system in mice.

Approaches for inducing plasticity in subcortical motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, could help to boost recovery after damage (e.g., stroke). In this study, we paired loud acoustic stimulation (LAS) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex in male and female healthy humans. LAS activates the reticular formation; TMS activates descending systems, including corticoreticular fibers. Two hundred paired stimuli were used, with 50 ms interstimulus interval at which LAS suppresses TMS responses. Before and after stimulus pairing, responses in the contralateral biceps muscle to TMS alone were measured. Ten, 20, and 30 min after stimulus pairing ended, TMS responses were enhanced, indicating the induction of LTP. No long-term changes were seen in control experiments which used 200 unpaired TMS or LAS, indicating the importance of associative stimulation. Following paired stimulation, no changes were seen in responses to direct corticospinal stimulation at the level of the medulla, or in the extent of reaction time shortening by a loud sound (StartReact effect), suggesting that plasticity did not occur in corticospinal or reticulospinal synapses. Direct measurements in female monkeys undergoing a similar paired protocol revealed no enhancement of corticospinal volleys after paired stimulation, suggesting no changes occurred in intracortical connections. The most likely substrate for the plastic changes, consistent with all our measurements, is an increase in the efficacy of corticoreticular connections.

The most likely substrate for the plastic changes, consistent with all our measurements, is an increase in the efficacy of corticoreticular connections. This new protocol may find utility, as it seems to target different motor circuits compared with other available paradigms."

The therapeutic mechanisms that take place before, during, or after SSRIs bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) are poorly understood, partially because no studies exist on the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of SSRIs in living cells. We studied escitalopram and fluoxetine using new intensity-based, drug-sensing fluorescent reporters targeted to the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured neurons and mammalian cell lines. We also used chemical detection of drug within cells and phospholipid membranes. The drugs attain equilibrium in neuronal cytoplasm and ER at approximately the same concentration as the externally applied solution, with time constants of a few s (escitalopram) or 200â300 s (fluoxetine). Simultaneously, the drugs accumulate within lipid membranes by â¥18-fold (escitalopram) or 180-fold (fluoxetine), and possibly by much larger factors. Both drugs leave cytoplasm, lumen, and membranes just as quickly during washout. We synthesized membrane-impermeant quaternary amine derivatives of the two SSRIs. The quaternary derivatives are substantially excluded from membrane, cytoplasm, and ER for >2.4 h. They inhibit SERT transport-associated currents sixfold or 11-fold less potently than the SSRIs (escitalopram or fluoxetine derivative, respectively), providing useful probes for distinguishing compartmentalized SSRI effects. Although our measurements are orders of magnitude faster than the therapeutic lag of SSRIs, these data suggest that SSRIâSERT interactions within organelles or membranes may play roles during either the therapeutic effects or the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed treatment for individuals experiencing major depressive disorder.

Age-related changes in several sleep characteristics indicate that reduced sleep quality is a frequent characteristic of aging. Conversely, sleep disruption may accelerate the aging process, yet it is not known what will happen to the age status of the brain if we can manipulate sleep conditions. To tackle this question, we used an approach of brain age to investigate whether sleep loss would cause age-related changes in the brain. We included MRI data of 134 healthy volunteers (mean chronological age of 25.3 between the age of 19 and 39 years, 42 females/92 males) from five datasets with different sleep conditions. Across three datasets with the condition of total sleep deprivation (>24 h of prolonged wakefulness), we consistently observed that total sleep deprivation increased brain age by 1â2 years regarding the group mean difference with the baseline. Interestingly, after one night of recovery sleep, brain age was not different from baseline. We also demonstrated the associations between the change in brain age after total sleep deprivation and the sleep variables measured during the recovery night. By contrast, brain age was not significantly changed by either acute (3 h time-in-bed for one night) or chronic partial sleep restriction (5 h time-in-bed for five continuous nights). Together, the convergent findings indicate that acute total sleep loss changes brain morphology in an aging-like direction in young participants and that these changes are reversible by recovery sleep.","Sleep loss pervasively affects the human brain at multiple levels.

We present a network model describing how the brain represents the semantic dependency relations among traits and uses this information to avoid an overall loss of positivity and coherence. Both male and female human participants received social feedback during a self-evaluation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We modeled self-belief updating by incorporating a reinforcement learning model within the network structure. Participants learned more rapidly from positive than negative feedback and were less likely to change self-views for traits with more dependencies in the network. Further, participants back propagated feedback across network relations while retrieving prior feedback on the basis of network similarity to inform ongoing self-views. Activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) reflected the constrained updating process such that positive feedback led to higher activation and negative feedback to less activation for traits with more dependencies. Additionally, vmPFC was associated with the novelty of a trait relative to previously self-evaluated traits in the network, and angular gyrus was associated with greater certainty for self-beliefs given the relevance of prior feedback.

This framework has been instrumental in identifying fundamental learning variables and their neuronal implementations. However, canonical RL models do not explain how reward values are constructed from biologically critical intrinsic reward components, such as nutrients. From an ecological perspective, animals should adapt their foraging choices in dynamic environments to acquire nutrients that are essential for survival. Here, to advance the biological and ecological validity of RL models, we investigated how (male) monkeys adapt their choices to obtain preferred nutrient rewards under varying reward probabilities. We found that the nutrient composition of rewards strongly influenced learning and choices. Preferences of the animals for specific nutrients (sugar, fat) affected how they adapted to changing reward probabilities; the history of recent rewards influenced choices of the monkeys more strongly if these rewards contained the their preferred nutrients (nutrient-specific reward history). The monkeys also chose preferred nutrients even when they were associated with lower reward probability. A nutrient-sensitive RL model captured these processes; it updated the values of individual sugar and fat components of expected rewards based on experience and integrated them into subjective values that explained the choices of the monkeys. Nutrient-specific reward prediction errors guided this value-updating process. Our results identify nutrients as important reward components that guide learning and choice by influencing the subjective value of choice options. Extending RL models with nutrient-value functions may enhance their biological validity and uncover nutrient-specific learning and decision variables.","In reinforcement learning (RL), animals choose by assigning values to options and learn by updating these values from reward outcomes.

At last, we reveal that the VIP and Î±7 cell models resonant with alpha/theta band input through a dynamic gain analysis."

Acid shifts in brain pH through the breathing of carbogen (5% CO2/95% O2) reduces seizure susceptibility in animal models and patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying this seizure protection remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that male and female mice exposed to carbogen are fully protected from thermogenic-triggered seizures. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that acid shifts in extracellular pH (pHo) significantly reduce action potential firing in CA1 pyramidal neurons but did not alter firing in hippocampal inhibitory interneurons. In real-time dynamic clamp experiments, acidification reduced simulated action potential firing generated in hybrid model neurons expressing the excitatory neuron predominant NaV1.2 channel. Conversely, acidification had no effect on action potential firing in hybrid model neurons expressing the interneuron predominant NaV1.1 channel. Furthermore, knockdown of Scn2a mRNA in vivo using antisense oligonucleotides reduced the protective effects of carbogen on seizure susceptibility. Both carbogen-mediated seizure protection and the reduction in CA1 pyramidal neuron action potential firing by low pHo were maintained in an Asic1a knock-out mouse ruling out this acid-sensing channel as the underlying molecular target. These data indicate that the acid-mediated reduction in excitatory neuron firing is mediated, at least in part, through the inhibition of NaV1.2 channels, whereas inhibitory neuron firing is unaffected. This reduction in pyramidal neuron excitability is the likely basis of seizure suppression caused by carbogen-mediated acidification.","Brain pH is a critical factor for determining neuronal activity, with alkalosis increasing and acidosis reducing excitability.

However, it is unknown which specific selection, decision, and/or motor processes provide the most specific indices of neurocognitive health. Here, using a simple decision task with electroencephalography (EEG), we found that the efficiency with which an individual accumulates sensory evidence was a critical determinant of the extent to which RS was preserved in older adults (63% female, 37% male). Moreover, the mitigating influence of EE on age-related RS declines was most pronounced when evidence accumulation rates were shallowest. These results suggest that the phenomenon of cognitive reserve, whereby high EE individuals can better tolerate suboptimal brain health to facilitate the preservation of cognitive function, is not just applicable to neuroanatomical indicators of brain ageing, but can be observed in markers of neurophysiology.

In the current study, we examined to which extent RPE signals are represented across different striatal regions. To do so, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic striatal territories of two male rhesus monkeys performing a free-choice probabilistic learning task. The trial-by-trial evolution of RPE during task performance was estimated using a reinforcement learning model fitted on monkeys' choice behavior. Overall, we found that changes in beta band oscillations (15â35 Hz), after the outcome of the animal's choice, are consistent with RPE encoding. Moreover, we provide evidence that the signals related to RPE are more strongly represented in the ventral (limbic) than dorsal (sensorimotor and associative) part of the striatum.

Here, we characterize the following three distinct forms of ethanol tolerance in male Drosophila: rapid, chronic, and repeated. Rapid tolerance is composed of two short-lived memory-like states, one that is labile and one that is consolidated. Chronic tolerance, induced by continuous exposure, lasts for 2 d, induces ethanol preference, and hinders the development of rapid tolerance through the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Unlike rapid tolerance, chronic tolerance is independent of the immediate early gene Hr38/Nr4a. Chronic tolerance is suppressed by the sirtuin HDAC Sirt1, whereas rapid tolerance is enhanced by Sirt1. Moreover, rapid and chronic tolerance map to anatomically distinct regions of the mushroom body learning and memory centers. Chronic tolerance, like long-term memory, is dependent on new protein synthesis and it induces the kayak/c-fos immediate early gene, but it depends on CREB signaling outside the mushroom bodies, and it does not require the Radish GTPase. Thus, chronic ethanol exposure creates an ethanol-specific memory-like state that is molecularly and anatomically different from other forms of ethanol tolerance.","Ethanol tolerance is the first type of behavioral plasticity and neural plasticity that is induced by ethanol intake, and yet its molecular and circuit bases remain largely unexplored.

Targeting the NFAT inhibitor VIVIT to astrocytes, using adeno-associated virus vectors, led to reduced GFAP promoter activity in HHcy diet mice and improved functional hyperemia in arterioles and capillaries. VIVIT expression in astrocytes also preserved CA1 synaptic function and improved spontaneous alternation performance on the Y maze.

We find that information storage and sharing are organized into substates across the stereotypic states of slow and [[theta, gamma]] oscillations in both epilepsy and control conditions. However, their internal composition and organization through time are disrupted in epilepsy, partially losing brain state selectivity as compared to controls, and shifting towards a regimen of disorder. We propose that the alteration of information processing at this algorithmic level of computation, the theoretical intermediate level between structure and function, may be a mechanism behind the emergent and widespread co-morbidities associated with epilepsy, and perhaps other disorders."

Within these circuits, neuronal ensembles, which represent subnetworks with shared functional connectivity, emerge in an experience-dependent manner. Here we induced ensembles in ex vivo cortical circuits from mice of either sex by differentially activating subpopulations through chronic optogenetic stimulation. We observed a decrease in voltage correlation, and importantly a synaptic decoupling between the stimulated and nonstimulated populations. We also observed a decrease in firing rate during Up-states in the stimulated population. These ensemble-specific changes were accompanied by decreases in intrinsic excitability in the stimulated population, and a decrease in connectivity between stimulated and nonstimulated pyramidal neurons. By incorporating the empirically observed changes in intrinsic excitability and connectivity into a spiking neural network model, we were able to demonstrate that changes in both intrinsic excitability and connectivity accounted for the decreased firing rate, but only changes in connectivity accounted for the observed decorrelation. Our findings help ascertain the mechanisms underlying the ability of chronic patterned stimulation to create ensembles within cortical circuits and, importantly, show that while Up-states are a global network-wide phenomenon, functionally distinct ensembles can preserve their identity during Up-states through differential firing rates and correlations.","Cortical computations emerge from the dynamics of neurons embedded in complex cortical circuits.

Current neurobiological models of semantic cognition are limited by the spatial and temporal restrictions of single-modality neuroimaging and lesion approaches. This is a major impediment given the rapid sequence of processing steps that have to be coordinated to accurately comprehend language. Through the use of fused functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography analysis in humans (n = 26 adults; 15 females), we elucidate a temporally and spatially specific neurobiological model for real-time semantic cognition. We find that semantic cognition in the context of language comprehension is supported by trade-offs between widespread neural networks over the course of milliseconds. Incorporation of spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as behavioral measures, provide convergent evidence for the following progression: a hippocampal/anterior temporal phonological semantic retrieval network (peaking at â¼300 ms after the sentence final word); a frontotemporal thematic semantic network (â¼400 ms); a hippocampal memory update network (â¼500 ms); an inferior frontal semantic syntactic reappraisal network (â¼600 ms); and nodes of the default mode network associated with conceptual coherence (â¼750 ms). Additionally, in typical adults, mediatory relationships among these networks are significantly predictive of language comprehension ability.

These adaptations vary in magnitude and direction following different patterns of opioid exposure, but few studies have systematically manipulated the pattern of opioid administration while measuring neurobiological impact. In this study, we compared cellular and synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens shell caused by morphine exposure that was either continuous or interrupted by daily bouts of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. At the behavioral level, continuous morphine administration caused psychomotor tolerance, which was reversed when the continuity of morphine action was interrupted by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Using ex vivo slice electrophysiology in female and male mice, we investigated how these patterns of morphine administration altered intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. We found that morphine-evoked adaptations at excitatory synapses were predominately conserved between patterns of administration, but there were divergent effects on inhibitory synapses and the subsequent balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Overall, our data suggest that continuous morphine administration produces adaptations that dampen the output of D1-MSNs, which are canonically thought to promote reward-related behaviors. Interruption of otherwise continuous morphine exposure does not dampen D1-MSN functional output to the same extent, which may enhance behavioral responses to subsequent opioid exposure. Our findings support the hypothesis that maintaining continuity of opioid administration could be an effective therapeutic strategy to minimize the vulnerability to opioid use disorders.","Opioid exposure and withdrawal both cause adaptations in brain circuits that may contribute to abuse liability.

This dopamine ramp was unaffected by probabilistic reward delivery, occurred exclusively before operant actions, and was not related to task performance or task acquisition as it persisted throughout the 2 week daily behavioral training. Instead, the ramp flexibly increased in duration with longer cue presentation, seemingly modulating the initial cue-onset-triggered dopamine release, that is, the reward prediction error (RPE) signal, as both signal amplitude and sustainment diminished when reward timing was made more predictable. Thus, our findings suggest that RPE and action components of dopamine release can be differentiated temporally into phasic and ramping/sustained signals, respectively, where the latter depends on the former and presumably reflects the anticipation or incentivization of appetitive action, conceptually akin to motivation.","The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in signaling reward-related information as well as in actions that generate rewarding outcomes.

Importantly, however, humans also show verbal fear learning. Namely, they have the ability to change their responses to stimuli rapidly through verbal instructions about CSâUS pairings.

Here, we have used EM tomography to generate high-resolution images of 3-D volumes of the rod synapse from the female domestic cat. We have resolved the synaptic ribbon as a single structure, with a single arciform density, indicating the presence of one long site of transmitter release. The organization of the postsynaptic processes, which has been difficult to resolve with past methods, appears as a tetrad arrangement of two horizontal cell and two rod bipolar cell processes. Retinal detachment severely disrupts this organization. After 7 d, EM tomography reveals withdrawal of rod bipolar dendrites from most spherules; fragmentation of synaptic ribbons, which lose their tight association with the presynaptic membrane; and loss of the highly branched telodendria of the horizontal cell axon terminals. After detachment, the hilus, the opening through which postsynaptic processes enter the invagination, enlarges, exposing the normally sequestered environment within the invagination to the extracellular space of the outer plexiform layer. Our use of EM tomography provides the most accurate description to date of the complex rod synapse and details changes it undergoes during outer segment degeneration. These changes would be expected to disrupt the flow of information in the rod pathway.","The rod photoreceptor synapse is the first synapse of dim-light vision and one of the most complex in the mammalian CNS.

We also coded cooperative behavior from audio recordings. We observed reduced conversational turn-taking behavior during the virtual condition. Given that conversational turn-taking was associated with other metrics of positive social interaction (e.g., subjective cooperation and task performance), this measure may be an indicator of prosocial interaction. In addition, we observed altered patterns of averaged and dynamic interbrain coherence in virtual interactions.

Recent data show that adding win-paired sound and light cues to the rat gambling task (rGT) potentiates risky decision-making and impulsivity via the dopamine system, and that changing dopaminergic tone has a greater influence on behavior while subjects are learning task contingencies. Dopamine agonist therapy may therefore be potentiating risk-taking by amplifying the behavioral impact of gambling-related cues on novel behavior. Here, we show that ropinirole treatment in male rats transiently increased motor impulsivity but robustly and progressively increased choice of the high-risk/high-reward options when administered during acquisition of the cued but not uncued rGT. Early in training, ropinirole increased win-stay behavior after large unlikely wins on the cued rGT, indicative of enhanced model-free learning, which mediated the drug's effect on later risk preference. Ex vivo cFos imaging showed that both chronic ropinirole and the addition of win-paired cues suppressed the activity of dopaminergic midbrain neurons. The ratio of midbrain:prefrontal cFos+ neurons was lower in animals with suboptimal choice patterns and tended to predict risk preference across all rats. Network analyses further suggested that ropinirole induced decoupling of the dopaminergic cells of the VTA and nucleus accumbens but only when win-paired cues were present. Frontostriatal activity uninformed by the endogenous dopaminergic teaching signal therefore appeared to perpetuate risky choice, and ropinirole exaggerated this disconnect in synergy with reward-paired cues.","Impulse control and/or gambling disorders can be triggered by dopamine agonist therapies used to treat Parkinson's disease, but the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are unknown.

However, most neuroimaging studies of word meaning use isolated words and isolated sentences with little context. Because the brain may process natural language differently from how it processes simplified stimuli, there is a pressing need to determine whether prior results on word meaning generalize to natural language. fMRI was used to record human brain activity while four subjects (two female) read words in four conditions that vary in context: narratives, isolated sentences, blocks of semantically similar words, and isolated words. We then compared the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of evoked brain responses, and we used a voxelwise encoding modeling approach to compare the representation of semantic information across the four conditions. We find four consistent effects of varying context. First, stimuli with more context evoke brain responses with higher SNR across bilateral visual, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices compared with stimuli with little context. Second, increasing context increases the representation of semantic information across bilateral temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices at the group level.

Reactive nitroxidative species, including NO and peroxynitrite (PN), have been implicated in nociceptive sensitization, and neutralizing PN is antinociceptive. We determined whether PN contributes to nociceptive responses in two distinct models of migraine headache. Female and male mice were subjected to 3 consecutive days of restraint stress or to dural stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Following resolution of the initial poststimulus behavioral responses, animals were tested for hyperalgesic priming using a normally non-noxious dose of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or dural pH 7.0, respectively. We measured periorbital von Frey and grimace responses in both models and measured stress-induced changes in 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) expression (a marker for PN activity) and trigeminal ganglia (TGs) mitochondrial function. Additionally, we recorded the neuronal activity of TGs in response to the PN generator SIN-1 [5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)â1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride]. We then tested the effects of the PN decomposition catalysts Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrin (FeTMPyP) and FeTPPS [Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato chloride], or the PN scavenger MnTBAP [Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin] against these behavioral, molecular, and neuronal changes. Neutralizing PN attenuated stress-induced periorbital hypersensitivity and priming to SNP, with no effect on priming to dural pH 7.0. These compounds also prevented stress-induced increases in 3-NT expression in both the TGs and dura mater, and attenuated TG neuronal hyperexcitability caused by SIN-1.

Nonstationary fluctuation analysis of two-photon evoked unitary synaptic currents showed that the postsynaptic component of E2-induced potentiation occurs either through an increase in AMPAR conductance or in nonconductive properties of AMPARs (number of channels Ã open probability) and never both at the same synapse. In females, most synapses (76%) were potentiated via increased AMPAR conductance, whereas in males, more synapses (60%) were potentiated via an increase in nonconductive AMPAR properties.

Nonstationary fluctuation analysis of two-photon evoked unitary synaptic currents showed that the postsynaptic component of E2-induced potentiation occurs either through [[an increase,a decrease]] in AMPAR conductance or in nonconductive properties of AMPARs (number of channels Ã open probability) and never both at the same synapse. In females, most synapses (76%) were potentiated via [[increased,decreased]] AMPAR conductance, whereas in males, more synapses (60%) were potentiated via [[an increase,a decrease]] in nonconductive AMPAR properties. Inhibition of cpAMPARs eliminated E2-induced synaptic potentiation in females, whereas some synapses in males were unaffected by cpAMPAR inhibition; these synapses in males potentiated exclusively via [[increased,decreased]] AMPAR nonconductive properties. This sex bias in expression mechanisms of E2-induced synaptic potentiation underscores the concept of latent sex differences in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in which the same outcome in each sex is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms."

To do both, the brain must fluctuate between states that are optimized for external vs. internal attention. Here, we focus on the hippocampus as a region that may serve at the interface between these forms of attention, and ask how it switches between prioritizing sensory signals from the external world vs. internal signals related to memories and thoughts. Pharmacological, computational, and animal studies have identified input from the cholinergic basal forebrain as important for biasing the hippocampus towards processing external information, whereas complementary research suggests the dorsal attention network (DAN) may aid in allocating attentional resources towards accessing internal information. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the basal forebrain and DAN drive the hippocampus towards external and internal attention, respectively. We used data from 29 human participants (17 female) who completed 2 attention tasks during fMRI. One task (âmemory-guidedâ) required proportionally more internal attention, and proportionally less external attention, than the other (âexplicitly instructedâ). We discovered that background functional connectivity between the basal forebrain and hippocampus was stronger during the explicitly instructed vs. memory-guided task. In contrast, DAN-hippocampus background connectivity was stronger during the memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed task. Finally, the strength of DAN-hippocampus background connectivity was correlated with performance on the memory-guided but not explicitly instructed task. Together, these results provide evidence that the basal forebrain and DAN may modulate the hippocampus to switch between external and internal attention.","Everyday experience requires processing external signals from the world around us and internal information retrieved from memory.

Here, we show that GVS is encoded by VIIIth nerve vestibular afferents with nonlinear dynamics that differ markedly from those predicted by current models. GVS produced asymmetric activation of both semicircular canal and otolith afferents to the onset versus offset and cathode versus anode of applied current, that in turn produced asymmetric eye movement responses in three awake-behaving male monkeys. Additionally, using computational methods, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed nonlinear neural response dynamics lead to an unexpected directional bias in the net population response when the information from both vestibular nerves is centrally integrated. Together our findings reveal the neural basis by which GVS activates the vestibular system, establish that neural response dynamics differ markedly from current predictions, and advance our mechanistic understanding of how asymmetric activation of the peripheral vestibular system alters vestibular function.

Within days, transplanted astrocytes developed morphologies and acquired territories and tiling behavior typical of cortical astrocytes. At 35â47 d post-transplantation, astrocytes appeared morphologically mature and expressed levels of EAAT2/GLT1 similar to nontransplanted astrocytes. Transplanted astrocytes also supported excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) presynaptic terminals within their territories, and displayed normal Ca2+ events. Transplanted astrocytes showed initially reduced expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) at endfeet and elevated expression of EAAT1/GLAST, with both proteins showing normalized expression by 110 d and one year post-transplantation, respectively. To understand how specific brain regions support astrocytic integration and maturation, we transplanted cortical astrocytes into the developing cerebellum. Cortical astrocytes interlaced with Bergmann glia (BG) in the cerebellar molecular layer to establish discrete territories. However, transplanted astrocytes retained many cortical astrocytic features including higher levels of EAAT2/GLT1, lower levels of EAAT1/GLAST, and the absence of expression of the AMPAR subunit GluA1.

Collectively, our findings demonstrate that immature cortical astrocytes integrate, mature, and survive (more than one year) following transplantation and retain cortical astrocytic properties. Astrocytic transplantation can be useful for investigating cell-autonomous (intrinsic) and non-cell-autonomous (environmental) mechanisms contributing to astrocytic development/diversity, and for determining the optimal timing for transplanting astrocytes for cellular delivery or replacement in regenerative medicine.","Astrocytes have complex structural, molecular, and physiological properties and form specialized microenvironments that support circuit-specific functions in the CNS. To better understand how astrocytes acquire their unique features, we transplanted immature mouse cortical astrocytes into the developing cortex of male and female mice and assessed their integration, maturation, and survival. Within days, transplanted astrocytes developed morphologies and acquired territories and tiling behavior typical of cortical astrocytes. At 35â47 d post-transplantation, astrocytes appeared morphologically mature and expressed levels of EAAT2/GLT1 similar to nontransplanted astrocytes. Transplanted astrocytes also supported excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) presynaptic terminals within their territories, and displayed normal Ca2+ events. Transplanted astrocytes showed initially reduced expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) at endfeet and elevated expression of EAAT1/GLAST, with both proteins showing normalized expression by 110 d and one year post-transplantation, respectively. To understand how specific brain regions support astrocytic integration and maturation, we transplanted cortical astrocytes into the developing cerebellum. Cortical astrocytes interlaced with Bergmann glia (BG) in the cerebellar molecular layer to establish discrete territories. However, transplanted astrocytes retained many cortical astrocytic features including [[higher,lower]] levels of EAAT2/GLT1, [[lower,higher]] levels of EAAT1/GLAST, and the [[absence,increase]] of expression of the AMPAR subunit GluA1.

Here, we examined how the primate vestibular system, independently and in combination with visual sensory input, contributes to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the range of dynamic motion experienced during daily life. We recorded activity of single motor units in the splenius capitis and sternocleidomastoid muscles in rhesus monkeys during yaw rotations spanning the physiological range of self-motion (up to 20 Hz) in darkness. Splenius capitis motor unit responses continued to increase with frequency up to 16 Hz in normal animals, and were strikingly absent following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. To determine whether visual information modulated these vestibular-driven neck muscle responses, we experimentally controlled the correspondence between visual and vestibular cues of self-motion. Surprisingly, visual information did not influence motor unit responses in normal animals, nor did it substitute for absent vestibular feedback following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. A comparison of muscle activity evoked by broadband versus sinusoidal head motion further revealed that low-frequency responses were attenuated when low- and high-frequency self-motion were experienced concurrently. Finally, we found that vestibular-evoked responses were enhanced by increased autonomic arousal, quantified via pupil size. Together, our findings directly establish the vestibular system's contribution to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the dynamic motion range experienced during everyday activities, as well as how vestibular, visual, and autonomic inputs are integrated for postural control.","To maintain stable posture of the head and body during our everyday activities, the brain integrates information across multiple sensory systems.

However, experimental and therapeutic approaches that modulate microglia function in a brain region-specific manner have not been established. In this study, we tested for the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a clinically used noninvasive brain stimulation technique, on microglia-mediated synaptic plasticity; 10 Hz electromagnetic stimulation triggered a release of plasticity-promoting cytokines from microglia in mouse organotypic brain tissue cultures of both sexes, while no significant changes in microglial morphology or microglia dynamics were observed. Indeed, substitution of tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) and interleukin 6 (IL6) preserved synaptic plasticity induced by 10 Hz stimulation in the absence of microglia. Consistent with these findings, in vivo depletion of microglia abolished rTMS-induced changes in neurotransmission in the mPFC of anesthetized mice of both sexes.

In this study, we tested for the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a clinically used noninvasive brain stimulation technique, on microglia-mediated synaptic plasticity; 10 Hz electromagnetic stimulation triggered a release of plasticity-promoting cytokines from microglia in mouse organotypic brain tissue cultures of both sexes, while no significant changes in microglial morphology or microglia dynamics were observed. Indeed, substitution of tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) and interleukin 6 (IL6) reduced synaptic plasticity induced by 10 Hz stimulation in the absence of microglia. Consistent with these findings, in vivo depletion of microglia increased rTMS-induced changes in neurotransmission in the mPFC of anesthetized mice of both sexes. We conclude that rTMS affects neural excitability and plasticity by suppressing the release of cytokines from microglia.","Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, sense the activity of neurons and regulate physiological brain functions.

Multiple pathophysiologic manifestations, along with many cellular and molecular alterations, have been linked to presbyacusis; however, the initial events and causal factors have not been clearly established. Comparisons of the transcriptome in the lateral wall (LW) with other cochlear regions in a mouse model (of both sexes) of ânormalâ age-related hearing loss revealed that early pathophysiological alterations in the stria vascularis (SV) are associated with increased macrophage activation and a molecular signature indicative of inflammaging, a common form of immune dysfunction. Structure-function correlation analyses in mice across the lifespan showed that the age-dependent increase in macrophage activation in the stria vascularis is associated with a decline in auditory sensitivity. High-resolution imaging analysis of macrophage activation in middle-aged and aged mouse and human cochleas, along with transcriptomic analysis of age-dependent changes in mouse cochlear macrophage gene expression, support the hypothesis that aberrant macrophage activity is an important contributor to age-dependent strial dysfunction, cochlear pathology, and hearing loss. Thus, this study highlights the SV as a primary site of age-related cochlear degeneration and aberrant macrophage activity and dysregulation of the immune system as early indicators of age-related cochlear pathology and hearing loss. Importantly, novel new imaging methods described here now provide a means to analyze human temporal bones in a way that had not previously been feasible and thereby represent a significant new tool for otopathological evaluation.","Age-related hearing loss, or presbyacusis, is a common degenerative disorder affecting communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.

The balance between these major progenitor types is critical for the production of the proper number and types of neurons, and it is thus important to decipher the cellular and molecular cues controlling this equilibrium. Here we address the role of a cell cycle regulator, the CDC25B phosphatase, in this process. We show that, in the developing mouse neocortex of both sex, deleting CDC25B in apical progenitors leads to a transient increase in the production of TBR1+ neurons at the expense of TBR2+ basal progenitors. This phenotype is associated with lengthening of the G2 phase of the cell cycle, the total cell cycle length being unaffected. Using in utero electroporation and cortical slice cultures, we demonstrate that the defect in TBR2+ basal progenitor production requires interaction with CDK1 and is because of the G2 phase lengthening in CDC25B mutants. Together, this study identifies a new role for CDC25B and G2 phase length in direct versus indirect neurogenesis at early stages of cortical development.","During development, cortical neurons are produced in a temporally regulated sequence from apical progenitors, directly or indirectly, through the production of intermediate basal progenitors.

We generated a rat model of human SCA34 by knock-in of a naturally occurring c.736T>G, p.W246G mutation in the Elovl4 gene. Our previous analysis of homozygous W246G mutant ELOVL4 rats (MUT) revealed early-onset gait disturbance and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) and climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms that caused these defects remained unknown. Here, we report detailed patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells that identify impaired synaptic mechanisms. Our results show that miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency is reduced in MUT rats with no change in mEPSC amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic defect of excitatory synaptic transmission on Purkinje cells.

Here, we recorded spiking responses to saccade-like shifts of luminance gratings from ganglion cells in isolated marmoset retinas and investigated how the activity depended on the combination of presaccadic and postsaccadic images. All identified cell types, On and Off parasol and midget cells, as well as a type of Large Off cells, displayed distinct response patterns, including particular sensitivity to either the presaccadic or the postsaccadic image or combinations thereof. In addition, Off parasol and Large Off cells, but not On cells, showed pronounced sensitivity to whether the image changed across the transition. Stimulus sensitivity of On cells could be explained based on their responses to step changes in light intensity, whereas Off cells, in particular, parasol and the Large Off cells, seem to be affected by additional interactions that are not triggered during simple light-intensity flashes. Together, our data show that ganglion cells in the primate retina are sensitive to different combinations of presaccadic and postsaccadic visual stimuli. This contributes to the functional diversity of the output signals of the retina and to asymmetries between On and Off pathways and provides evidence of signal processing beyond what is triggered by isolated steps in light intensity.","Saccades are a fundamental part of natural vision.

Studies in transgenic mice and humans with sex chromosome trisomy (SCT) have revealed direct SCD effects on regional mammalian brain anatomy, but we lack a formal test for cross-species conservation of these effects. Here, we develop a harmonized framework for comparative structural neuroimaging and apply this to systematically profile SCD effects on regional brain anatomy in both humans and mice by contrasting groups with SCT (XXY and XYY) versus XY controls. Total brain size was substantially altered by SCT in humans (significantly decreased by XXY and increased by XYY), but not in mice. Robust and spatially convergent effects of XXY and XYY on regional brain volume were observed in humans, but not mice, when controlling for global volume differences. However, mice do show subtle effects of XXY and XYY on regional volume, although there is not a general spatial convergence in these effects within mice or between species. Notwithstanding this general lack of conservation in SCT effects, we detect several brain regions that show overlapping effects of XXY and XYY both within and between species (cerebellar, parietal, and orbitofrontal cortex), thereby nominating high priority targets for future translational dissection of SCD effects on the mammalian brain. Our study introduces a generalizable framework for comparative neuroimaging in humans and mice and applies this to achieve a cross-species comparison of SCD effects on the mammalian brain through the lens of SCT.","All eutherian mammals show chromosomal sex determination with contrasting sex chromosome dosages (SCDs) between males (XY) and females (XX).

In contrast to the progress in understanding the central mechanisms of autonomous thermoregulation, those of behavioral thermoregulation remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) mediates cutaneous thermosensory afferent signaling for thermoregulation. To understand the thermosensory neural network for behavioral thermoregulation, in the present study, we investigated the roles of ascending thermosensory pathways from the LPB in avoidance behavior from innocuous heat and cold in male rats. Neuronal tracing revealed two segregated groups of LPB neurons projecting to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), a thermoregulatory center (LPBâMnPO neurons), and those projecting to the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA), a limbic emotion center (LPBâCeA neurons). While LPBâMnPO neurons include separate subgroups activated by heat or cold exposure of rats, LPBâCeA neurons were only activated by cold exposure. By selectively inhibiting LPBâMnPO or LPBâCeA neurons using tetanus toxin light chain or chemogenetic or optogenetic techniques, we found that LPBâMnPO transmission mediates heat avoidance, whereas LPBâCeA transmission contributes to cold avoidance. In vivo electrophysiological experiments showed that skin cooling-evoked thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue requires not only LPBâMnPO neurons but also LPBâCeA neurons, providing a novel insight into the central mechanism of autonomous thermoregulation. Our findings reveal an important framework of central thermosensory afferent pathways to coordinate behavioral and autonomous thermoregulation and to generate the emotions of thermal comfort and discomfort that drive thermoregulatory behavior.","Thermoregulatory behavior in homeothermic animals is an innate behavior to defend body core temperature from environmental thermal challenges in coordination with autonomous thermoregulatory responses.

Prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) is a stress mediator; we therefore hypothesized that PrRP may be involved in the development of stress disorders. PrRP is produced by the medullary A1/A2 noradrenaline (NA) cells, which transmit stress signals to forebrain centers, and by non-NA cells in the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus. We found in male rats that both PrRP and PrRP-NA cells innervate melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) producing neurons in the dorsolateral hypothalamus (DLH). These cells serve as a key hub for regulating sleep and affective states. Ex vivo, PrRP hyperpolarized MCH neurons and further increased the hyperpolarization caused by NA. Following sleep deprivation, intracerebroventricular PrRP injection reduced the number of REM sleep-active MCH cells. PrRP expression in the dorsomedial nucleus was upregulated by sleep deprivation, while downregulated by REM sleep rebound. Both in learned helplessness paradigm and after peripheral inflammation, impaired coping with sustained stress was associated with (1) overactivation of PrRP cells, (2) PrRP protein and receptor depletion in the DLH, and (3) dysregulation of MCH expression. Exposure to stress in the PrRP-insensitive period led to increased passive coping with stress. Normal PrRP signaling, therefore, seems to protect animals against stress-related disorders. PrRP signaling in the DLH is an important component of the PrRP's action, which may be mediated by MCH neurons. Moreover, PrRP receptors were downregulated in the DLH of human suicidal victims. As stress-related mental disorders are the leading cause of suicide, our findings may have particular translational relevance.","Stress disorders impair sleep and quality of life; however, their pathomechanisms are unknown.

We focus on the ability of visuo-semantic models, consisting of human-generated labels of object features and categories, to explain variance beyond the explanatory power of DNNs alone.

Here, we tracked the neural representations of expected and unexpected material behaviors using time-resolved EEG decoding in a violation-of-expectation paradigm, where objects fell to the ground and deformed in expected or unexpected ways.

Second, objects exhibiting unexpected material behaviors were more successfully decoded than objects exhibiting expected behaviors within 190 ms after the impact, which might indicate additional processing demands when expectations are unmet. Third, general signals of expectation fulfillment that generalize across specific objects and materials were found within the first 150 ms after the impact. Together, our results provide new insights into the temporal neural processing cascade that underlies the analysis of real-world material behaviors.

Analyzing a sample of 71 neurons (in anesthetized, paralyzed cats of either sex) has revealed their responses to be more driven by dark than light stimuli, consistent with previous investigations. We show that this asymmetry is predominantly because of slower inhibition to dark stimuli rather than to stronger excitation from the thalamocortical OFF pathway. Consistent with dark-dominant neurons having faster responses than light-dominant neurons, we find dark-dominance to [[solely,also]] occur in the [[early,late]] latencies of neurons' responses. Neurons that are strongly dark-dominated also tend to be [[less,more]] orientation-selective. This novel approach gives us new insight into the dark-dominance phenomenon and provides an avenue to address new questions about excitatory and inhibitory integration in cortical neurons."

Optimal feedback control is a theory that has guided many behavioral studies exploring how the motor system incorporates task redundancy. This theory predicts that kinematic errors that deviate the limb should not be corrected if one can still attain the behavioral goal. Studies in humans demonstrate that the motor system can flexibly integrate visual and proprioceptive feedback of the limb with goal redundancy within 90 ms and 70 ms, respectively. Here, we show monkeys (Macaca mulatta) demonstrate similar abilities to exploit goal redundancy. We trained four male monkeys to reach for a goal that was either a narrow square or a wide, spatially redundant rectangle. Monkeys exhibited greater trial-by-trial variability when reaching to the wide goal consistent with exploiting goal redundancy. On random trials we jumped the visual feedback of the hand and found monkeys corrected for the jump when reaching to the narrow goal and largely ignored the jump when reaching for the wide goal. In a separate set of experiments, we applied mechanical loads to the arm of the monkey and found similar corrective responses based on goal shape. Muscle activity reflecting these different corrective responses were detected for the visual and mechanical perturbations starting at â¼90 and â¼70 ms, respectively. Thus, rapid motor responses in macaques can exploit goal redundancy similar to humans, creating a paradigm to study the neural basis of goal-directed motor action and motor redundancy.","A common problem in motor control concerns how to generate patterns of muscle activity when there are redundant solutions to attain a behavioral goal.

Recent behavioral research has shown that expectations about the spatial location of distractors within a search array are implicitly learned, with expected distractors becoming less interfering. Little is known about the neural mechanism supporting this form of statistical learning. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure human brain activity to test whether proactive mechanisms are involved in the statistical learning of distractor locations. Specifically, we used a new technique called rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT) to assess neural excitability in early visual cortex during statistical learning of distractor suppression while concurrently investigating the modulation of posterior alpha band activity (8â12 Hz). Male and female human participants performed a visual search task in which a target was occasionally presented alongside a color-singleton distractor. Unbeknown to the participants, the distracting stimuli were presented with different probabilities across the two hemifields. RIFT analysis showed that early visual cortex exhibited reduced neural excitability in the prestimulus interval at retinotopic locations associated with higher distractor probabilities. In contrast, we did not find any evidence of expectation-driven distractor suppression in alpha band activity. These findings indicate that proactive mechanisms of attention are involved in predictive distractor suppression and that these mechanisms are associated with altered neural excitability in early visual cortex. Moreover, our findings indicate that RIFT and alpha band activity might subtend different and possibly independent attentional mechanisms.","Visual attention is highly influenced by past experiences.

We aimed to quantify how interictal brain activity differs from that in healthy individuals, and identify what features of interictal activity influence seizure occurrence in a genetic mouse model of childhood epilepsy. Neural activity across the majority of the dorsal cortex was monitored with widefield Ca2+ imaging in mice of both sexes expressing a human Kcnt1 variant (Kcnt1m/m) and wild-type controls (WT). Ca2+ signals during seizures and interictal periods were classified according to their spatiotemporal features. We identified 52 spontaneous seizures, which emerged and propagated within a consistent set of susceptible cortical areas, and were predicted by a concentration of total cortical activity within the emergence zone. Outside of seizures and IEDs, similar events were detected in Kcnt1m/m and WT mice, suggesting that the spatial structure of interictal activity is similar. However, the rate of events whose spatial profile overlapped with where seizures and IEDs emerged was increased, and the characteristic global intensity of cortical activity in individual Kcnt1m/m mice predicted their epileptic activity burden. This suggests that cortical areas with excessive interictal activity are vulnerable to seizures, but epilepsy is not an inevitable outcome.

This is especially challenging in the human brain where the response properties of individual neurons are sparse and heterogeneous. Here we use microelectrode arrays in the human anterior temporal lobe in 6 participants (3 female) to examine the spiking responses of individual neurons to microstimulation delivered through multiple distinct stimulation sites. We demonstrate that individual neurons can be driven with excitation or inhibition using different stimulation sites, which suggests an approach for providing direct control of spiking activity at the single-neuron level. Spiking responses are inhibitory in neurons that are close to the site of stimulation, while excitatory responses are more spatially distributed. Together, our data demonstrate that spiking responses of individual neurons can be reliably identified and manipulated in the human cortex.","Microstimulation can modulate the activity of individual neurons to affect behavior, but the effects of stimulation on neuronal spiking are complex and remain poorly understood.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1418-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Cognition and brain structure undergo significant maturation from adolescence into adulthood. Model-based (MB) control is known to increase across development, which is mediated by cognitive abilities. Here, we asked two questions unaddressed in previous developmental studies. First, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Second, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A human developmental sample (n = 103; age, 12â50, male/female, 55:48) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive versus negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that gray matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. Although motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in positive feedback learning was mediated by reduced GMD in the parietal, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that brain maturation, putatively reflected in lower GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions could lead to a more efficient brain organization and might thus be a key developmental step toward age-related increases in planning and value-based choice.","Cognition and brain structure undergo significant maturation from adolescence into adulthood.

Whether extinction encoding requires activity in the IL exclusively or also activity in its outputs, such as those to the NAshell and amygdala, is unknown. To address this issue, we used a closed-loop optogenetic approach in female and male Sprague Dawley rats to silence ILâNAshell or ILâamygdala activity following an unreinforced lever press during extinction training. Optical illumination (20 s) was given either immediately after a lever press or following a 20 s delay. ILâNAshell inhibition immediately following an unreinforced lever press increased lever pressing during extinction training and impaired retention of extinction learning, as assessed during subsequent extinction sessions without optical inhibition. Likewise, ILâamygdala inhibition given in the same manner impaired extinction retention during sessions without inhibition. Control experiments indicate that critical encoding of extinction learning does not require activity in these pathways beyond the initial 20 s post-lever press period, as delayed ILâNAshell and ILâamygdala inhibition had no effect on extinction learning.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1827-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Behavioral consequences and neural underpinnings of visuospatial attention have long been investigated. Classical studies using the Posner paradigm have found that visual perception systematically benefits from the use of a spatially informative cue pointing to the to-be-attended spatial location, compared with a noninformative cue. Lateralized Î± amplitude modulation during visuospatial attention shifts has been suggested to account for such perceptual gain. However, recent studies on spontaneous fluctuations of prestimulus Î± amplitude have challenged this notion. These studies showed that spontaneous fluctuations of prestimulus Î± amplitude were associated with the subjective appreciation of stimulus occurrence, while objective accuracy was instead best predicted by the frequency of Î± oscillations, with faster prestimulus Î± frequency accounting for better perceptual performance. Here, in male and female humans, by using an informative cue in anticipation of lateralized stimulus presentation, we found that the predictive cue not only modulates preparatory Î± amplitude but also Î± frequency in a retinotopic manner. Behaviorally, the cue significantly impacted subjective performance measures (metacognitive abilities [meta-dâ²]) and objective performance gain (dâ²). Importantly, Î± amplitude directly accounted for confidence levels, with ipsilateral synchronization and contralateral desynchronization coding for high-confidence responses. Crucially, the contralateral Î± amplitude selectively predicted interindividual differences in metacognitive abilities (meta-dâ²), thus anticipating decision strategy and not perceptual sensitivity, probably via excitability modulations. Instead, higher perceptual accuracy both within and across participants (dâ²) was associated with faster contralateral Î± frequency, likely by implementing higher sampling at the attended location. These findings provide critical new insights into the neural mechanisms of attention control and its perceptual consequences.","Behavioral consequences and neural underpinnings of visuospatial attention have long been investigated.

However, this relation has been unclear. To investigate this question, we used an in vivo microendoscope calcium imaging technique to optically record neuronal activity in the dCA1 of male and female mice.

Accordingly, when such patterns were more similar between conditioned and neutral context, animals displayed proportionally more similar level of freezing.

The present study therefore examined the behavioral and neural effects of the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan on social reward and punishment processing in humans. A preregistered randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subject pharmacological design was combined with a social incentive delay (SID) functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm during which subjects could avoid social punishment or gain social reward. Healthy volunteers received a single-dose of losartan (50 mg, n = 43, female = 17) or placebo (n = 44, female = 20). We evaluated reaction times (RTs) and emotional ratings as behavioral and activation and functional connectivity as neural outcomes. Relative to placebo, losartan modulated the reaction time and arousal differences between social punishment and social reward. On the neural level the losartan-enhanced motivational salience of social rewards was accompanied by stronger ventral striatum-prefrontal connectivity during reward anticipation. Losartan increased the reward-neutral difference in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and attenuated VTA associated connectivity with the bilateral insula in response to punishment during the outcome phase. Thus, losartan modulated approach-avoidance motivation and emotional salience during social punishment versus social reward via modulating distinct core nodes of the midbrain-striato-frontal circuits. The findings document a modulatory role of the renin-angiotensin system in these circuits and associated social processes, suggesting a promising treatment target to alleviate social dysregulations.","Social deficits and dysregulations in dopaminergic midbrain-striato-frontal circuits represent transdiagnostic symptoms across psychiatric disorders.

We evaluated reaction times (RTs) and emotional ratings as behavioral and activation and functional connectivity as neural outcomes. Relative to placebo, losartan modulated the reaction time and arousal differences between social punishment and social reward. On the neural level the losartan-enhanced motivational salience of social rewards was accompanied by stronger [[ventral, dorsal]] striatum-prefrontal connectivity during reward anticipation. Losartan increased the reward-neutral difference in the [[ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra (SN)]] and attenuated [[VTA, SN]] associated connectivity with the bilateral insula in response to punishment during the outcome phase. Thus, losartan modulated approach-avoidance motivation and emotional salience during social punishment versus social reward via modulating distinct core nodes of the midbrain-striato-frontal circuits. The findings document a modulatory role of the renin-angiotensin system in these circuits and associated social processes, suggesting a promising treatment target to alleviate social dysregulations."

Such domain-preferring activity distribution in the pulvinar was associated with the magnitude with which the voxels were intrinsically connected with the corresponding domain-preferring regions in the cortex. The pulvinar-to-right-amygdala path showed a one-way shortcut supporting the perception of animals, and the modulation connection from pulvinar to parietal showed an advantage to the perception of tools. These results incorporate the subcortical regions into the object processing network and highlight that domain organization appears to be an overarching principle across various processing stages in the brain.","Distributed cortical regions show differential responses to visual objects belonging to different domains varying by animacy (e.g., animals vs tools), yet it remains unclear whether this is an organization principle also applying to the subcortical structures.

However, this overrepresentation compromises the detection of approaching objects, which is essential for survival. In the present study, we revisited this long-held notion by reanalyzing motion selectivity in area MT of three macaque monkeys (two males, one female) using random-dot stimuli instead of spot stimuli. We found no differences in the number of neurons tuned to centrifugal versus centripetal motion; however, centrifugally tuned neurons showed stronger tuning than centripetally tuned neurons. This was attributed to the heightened suppression of responses in centrifugal neurons to centripetal motion compared with that of centripetal neurons to centrifugal motion. Our modeling implies that this intensified suppression accounts for superior detection performance for weak centripetal motion stimuli. Moreover, through Fisher information analysis, we establish that the population sensitivity to motion direction in peripheral vision corresponds well with retinal motion statistics during forward locomotion. While these results challenge established concepts, considering the interplay of logarithmic Gaussian receptive fields and spot stimuli can shed light on the previously documented overrepresentation of centrifugal motion. Significantly, our findings reconcile a previously found discrepancy between MT activity and human behavior, highlighting the proficiency of peripheral MT neurons in encoding motion direction efficiently.","The overrepresentation of centrifugal motion in the middle temporal visual area (area MT) has long been thought to provide an efficient coding strategy for optic flow processing.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1997-22.2023,Neurobiology of Disease,"SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans leads to severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and sensory processing deficits. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. In mice, a decrease of SynGAP levels results in cognitive deficits by interfering with the development of excitatory glutamatergic connections. Recent evidence suggests that SynGAP also plays a crucial role in the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the expression of SYNGAP1 in inhibitory interneurons contributes to cortical circuit function and related behaviors. The activity of cortical neurons has not been measured simultaneously with behavior. To address these gaps, we recorded from layer 2/3 neurons in the primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) of mice while they learned to perform a whisker tactile detection task. Our results demonstrate that mice with interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency exhibit learning deficits characterized by heightened behavioral responses in the absence of relevant sensory input and premature responses to unrelated sensory stimuli not associated with reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by specific circuit abnormalities within wS1. Interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency increases detrimental neuronal correlations directly related to task performance and enhances responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli unrelated to the reward acquisition. In summary, our findings indicate that a reduction of SynGAP in inhibitory interneurons impairs sensory representation in the primary sensory cortex by disrupting neuronal correlations, which likely contributes to the observed cognitive deficits in mice with pan-neuronal SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.","SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans leads to severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and sensory processing deficits. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. In mice, a decrease of SynGAP levels results in cognitive deficits by interfering with the development of excitatory glutamatergic connections. Recent evidence suggests that SynGAP also plays a crucial role in the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the expression of SYNGAP1 in inhibitory interneurons contributes to cortical circuit function and related behaviors. The activity of cortical neurons has not been measured simultaneously with behavior.

However, the role of endogenously synthesized creatine on CNS development and function remains poorly understood. Here, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of adult mouse brains from both sexes revealed creatine synthesis is dependent on the expression of the enzyme, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT). To identify Gamt-expressed cells, and how Gamtaffects postnatal CNS development, we generated a mouse line by knocking-in a GFP, which is expressed on excision of Gamt. We found that Gamt is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes during active myelination in the developing postnatal CNS. Homozygous deletion of Gamt resulted in significantly reduced mature oligodendrocytes and delayed myelination in the corpus callosum. Moreover, the absence of endogenous creatine resulted in altered AMPK signaling in the brain, reduced brain creatine kinase expression in cortical neurons, and signs of axonal damage. Experimental demyelination in mice after tamoxifen-induced conditional deletion of Gamt in oligodendrocyte lineage cells resulted in delayed maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelin coverage in lesions. Moreover, creatine and cyclocreatine supplementation can enhance remyelination after demyelination. Our results suggest endogenously synthesized creatine controls the bioenergetic demand required for the timely maturation of oligodendrocytes during postnatal CNS development, and that delayed myelination and altered CNS energetics through the disruption of creatine synthesis might contribute to conditions, such as CCDS.","Cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome (CCDS) is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by intellectual delays, seizures, and autistic-like behavior.

According to prevailing views, short sleep increases risk of lower brain health and cognitive function. Chronic mild sleep deprivation could cause undetected sleep debt, negatively affecting cognitive function and brain health. However, it is possible that some have less sleep need and are more resistant to negative effects of sleep loss. We investigated this using a cross-sectional and longitudinal sample of 47,029 participants of both sexes (20â89 years) from the Lifebrain consortium, Human Connectome project (HCP) and UK Biobank (UKB), with measures of self-reported sleep, including 51,295 MRIs of the brain and cognitive tests. A total of 740 participants who reported to sleep <6 h did not experience daytime sleepiness or sleep problems/disturbances interfering with falling or staying asleep. These short sleepers showed significantly larger regional brain volumes than both short sleepers with daytime sleepiness and sleep problems (n = 1742) and participants sleeping the recommended 7â8 h (n = 3886). However, both groups of short sleepers showed slightly lower general cognitive function (GCA), 0.16 and 0.19 SDs, respectively. Analyses using accelerometer-estimated sleep duration confirmed the findings, and the associations remained after controlling for body mass index, depression symptoms, income, and education. The results suggest that some people can cope with less sleep without obvious negative associations with brain morphometry and that sleepiness and sleep problems may be more related to brain structural differences than duration. However, the slightly lower performance on tests of general cognitive abilities warrants closer examination in natural settings.","Many sleep less than recommended without experiencing daytime sleepiness.

Sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating are considered as two contending sources of the repulsive bias, yet no neural support has been provided for either source. Here, we explored human brains of both men and women, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to find such support by relating the brain signals of sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating to human classification behavior. We found that the stimulus-encoding signal in the early visual cortex adapted to previous stimuli, yet its adaptation-related changes were dissociated from current choices. Contrastingly, the boundary-representing signals in the inferior-parietal and superior-temporal cortices shifted to previous stimuli and covaried with current choices. Our exploration points to boundary-updating, rather than sensory-adaptation, as the origin of the repulsive bias in binary classification.","Binary classification, an act of sorting items into two classes by setting a boundary, is biased by recent history.

The brain mechanisms underlying such semantic composition remain poorly understood. To shed light on the neural vector code underlying semantic composition, we introduce two hypotheses: (1) the intrinsic dimensionality of the space of neural representations should increase as a sentence unfolds, paralleling the growing complexity of its semantic representation; and (2) this progressive integration should be reflected in ramping and sentence-final signals. To test these predictions, we designed a dataset of closely matched normal and jabberwocky sentences (composed of meaningless pseudo words) and displayed them to deep language models and to 11 human participants (5 men and 6 women) monitored with simultaneous MEG and intracranial EEG. In both deep language models and electrophysiological data, we found that representational dimensionality was higher for meaningful sentences than jabberwocky. Furthermore, multivariate decoding of normal versus jabberwocky confirmed three dynamic patterns: (1) a phasic pattern following each word, peaking in temporal and parietal areas; (2) a ramping pattern, characteristic of bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri; and (3) a sentence-final pattern in left superior frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex. These results provide a first glimpse into the neural geometry of semantic integration and constrain the search for a neural code of linguistic composition.","A sentence is more than the sum of its words: its meaning depends on how they combine with one another.

The automatic formation, and later retrieval, of such conjunctive representations can substantially facilitate efficient action selection. However, recent behavioral work suggests that these event files may also adversely affect future behavior, especially when action requirements have changed between successive instances of the same task context (e.g., during task switching). Here, we directly tested this hypothesis with a recently developed method for measuring the strength of the neural representations of context-specific stimulusâaction conjunctions (i.e., event files). Thirty-five male and female adult humans performed a task switching paradigm while undergoing EEG recordings. Replicating previous behavioral work, we found that changes in action requirements between two spaced repetitions of the same task incurred a significant reaction time cost. By combining multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis of the EEG recordings with linear mixed-effects modeling of trial-to-trial behavior, we then found that the magnitude of this behavioral cost was directly proportional to the strength of the conjunctive representation formed during the most recent previous exposure to the same task, that is, the most recent event file. This confirms that the formation of conjunctive representations of specific task contexts, stimuli, and actions in the brain can indeed adversely affect future behavior. Moreover, these findings demonstrate the potential of neural decoding of complex task set representations toward the prediction of behavior beyond the current trial.","During goal-directed behavior, humans purportedly form and retrieve so-called event files, conjunctive representations that link context-specific information about stimuli, their associated actions, and the expected action outcomes.

However, because of the vast diversity in neuronal class and function, it is unclear whether or not all neurons use the same organizational mechanisms to form synaptic connections and achieve functional and morphologic maturation. Moreover, it remains unknown whether neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and use identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the Drosophila antennal lobe (AL), a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons of both sexes throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3Î², suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3Î² kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3Î² loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental time frames and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.","Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits.

Using pictures with hidden objects as standard stimuli and similar pictures without hidden objects as deviant stimuli, we investigated the neural representation of prior knowledge and its impact on conscious perception in an oddball paradigm using electroencephalogram (EEG) in both male and female human subjects. We found that the neural patterns between the prestimulus alpha band oscillations and poststimulus EEG activity were significantly more similar for the standard stimuli than for the deviant stimuli after prior knowledge was provided. Furthermore, decoding analysis revealed that persistent neural templates were evoked after the introduction of prior knowledge, similar to that evoked in the early stages of visual processing.

Human data included slowly-adapting Type-II (SA-II) afferents, which are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5â7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 human subjects (19 females). Torques were superimposed on a 2, 3, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary recordings were made from fast-adapting Type-I (FA-I, n = 39), and slowly-adapting Type-I (SA-I, n = 31) and Type-II (SA-II, n = 13) afferents supplying the fingerpads via microelectrodes inserted into the median nerve. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with torque sensitivity being higher with smaller normal forces. SA-I afferent responses to static torque were inferior to dynamic stimuli in humans, while in monkeys the opposite was true. In humans this might be compensated by the addition of sustained SA-II afferent input, and their capacity to increase or decrease firing rates with direction of rotation. We conclude that the discrimination capacity of individual afferents of each type was inferior in humans than monkeys which could be because of differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction.","Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces. We investigated how torque information is encoded by human tactile afferents in the fingerpads and compared them to 97 afferents recorded in monkeys (n = 3; 2 females) in our previous study.

Despite intense interest in the sodium gating mechanism, a comprehensive investigation to identify the sodium-sensitive and chloride-sensitive sites has been missing. In the present study, we identified two potential sodium-binding sites in the C-terminal domain of the rat Slack channel by conducting electrophysical recordings and systematic mutagenesis of cytosolic acidic residues in the rat Slack channel C terminus. In particular, by taking advantage of the M335A mutant, which results in the opening of the Slack channel in the absence of cytosolic sodium, we found that among the 92 screened negatively charged amino acids, E373 mutants could completely remove sodium sensitivity of the Slack channel. In contrast, several other mutants showed dramatic decreases in sodium sensitivity but did not abolish it altogether. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed at the hundreds of nanoseconds timescale revealed one or two sodium ions at the E373 position or an acidic pocket composed of several negatively charged residues. Moreover, the MD simulations predicted possible chloride interaction sites. By screening predicted positively charged residues, we identified R379 as a chloride interaction site. Thus, we conclude that the E373 site and the D863/E865 pocket are two potential sodium-sensitive sites, while R379 is a chloride interaction site in the Slack channel.","The Slack channel (KCNT1, Slo2.2) is a sodium-activated and chloride-activated potassium channel that regulates heart rate and maintains the normal excitability of the nervous system.

How these circuits become disrupted during withdrawal is poorly understood. Because amygdala neurons mediate relapse, and are highly opioid sensitive, we hypothesized that opioid withdrawal would induce adaptations in these neurons, opening a window of disrupted emotional learning circuit function. Under normal physiological conditions, synaptic transmission between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the neighboring main island (Im) of GABAergic intercalated cells (ITCs) is strongly inhibited by endogenous opioids.

Reduced peptide control of neurotransmission in the amygdala shifts the excitatory/inhibitory balance of inputs onto accumbens-projecting amygdala cells involved in relapse. These findings provide novel insights into how peptidases control synaptic activity within the amygdala and presents restoration of endogenous peptide activity during withdrawal as a viable option to mitigate withdrawal-induced disruptions in emotional learning circuits and rescue the relapse behaviors exhibited during opioid withdrawal and beyond into abstinence.","While the physical signs of opioid withdrawal are most readily observable, withdrawal insidiously drives relapse and contributes to compulsive drug use, by disrupting emotional learning circuits.

Manually defining thousands of sulci revealed that LPFC sulcal morphology (depth, surface area, and gray matter thickness) differed between children (6-11 years old)/adolescents (11-18 years old) and young adults (22-36 years old) cross-sectionally, but only cortical thickness showed differences across childhood and adolescence and presented longitudinal changes during childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, a data-driven approach relating morphology and cognition identified that longitudinal changes in cortical thickness of four left-hemisphere LPFC sulci predicted longitudinal changes in reasoning performance, a higher-level cognitive ability that relies on LPFC. Contrary to previous findings, these results suggest that sulci may flatten either after this time frame or over a longer longitudinal period of time than previously presented. Crucially, these results also suggest that longitudinal changes in the cortex within specific LPFC sulci are behaviorally meaningful, providing targeted structures, and areas of the cortex, for future neuroimaging studies examining the development of cognitive abilities.","Previous findings show that the morphology of folds (sulci) of the human cerebral cortex flatten during postnatal development.

We found parietal neurons encoding the behavioral context instructed by cues that exhibited nearly identical activity to their prefrontal counterparts (Blackman et al., 2016).

A dominant model posits that envelope tracking reflects entrainment of endogenous low-frequency oscillations to the speech envelope. Alternatively, envelope tracking reflects a series of evoked responses to acoustic landmarks within the envelope. It has proven challenging to distinguish these two mechanisms. To address this, we recorded MEG while participants (n = 12, 6 female) listened to natural speech, and compared the neural phase patterns to the predictions of two computational models: an oscillatory entrainment model and a model of evoked responses to peaks in the rate of envelope change. Critically, we also presented speech at slowed rates, where the spectro-temporal predictions of the two models diverge. Our analyses revealed transient theta phase-locking in regular speech, as predicted by both models. However, for slow speech, we found transient theta and delta phase-locking, a pattern that was fully compatible with the evoked response model but could not be explained by the oscillatory entrainment model. Furthermore, encoding of acoustic edge magnitudes was invariant to contextual speech rate, demonstrating speech rate normalization of acoustic edge representations.

Using two-photon calcium imaging with female flies, we demonstrated that a specific population of R neurons that innervate the superior domain of bulb neuropil, termed superior R neurons, encoded a motion-defined bar with high spatial frequency contents. Upstream superior tuberculo-bulbar (TuBu) neurons transmitted visual signals by releasing acetylcholine within synapses connected with superior R neurons. Blocking TuBu or R neurons impaired tracking performance of the bar, which reveals their importance in motion-defined feature encoding. Additionally, the presentation of a low spatial frequency luminance-defined bar evoked consistent excitation in R neurons of the superior bulb, whereas either excited or inhibited responses were evoked in the inferior bulb. The distinct properties of the responses to the two bar stimuli indicate there is a functional division between the bulb subdomains. Moreover, physiological and behavioral tests with restricted lines suggest that R4d neurons play a vital role in tracking motion-defined bars. We conclude that the central complex receives the motion-defined features via a visual pathway from superior TuBu to R neurons and might encode different visual features via distinct response patterns at the population level, thereby driving visually guided behaviors.","Relative motion breaks a camouflaged target from a same-textured background, thus eliciting discrimination of a motion-defined object.

Intact cats always cleared obstacles without contact. At weeks 1-2 after hemisection, the ipsilesional right hindlimb contacted obstacles in â¼50% of trials, triggering a stumbling corrective reaction or absent responses, which we termed Other. When complete clearance occurred, we observed exaggerated ipsilesional hindlimb flexion when crossing the obstacle with contralesional Left limbs leading. At weeks 7-8 after hemisection, the proportion of complete clearance increased, Other responses decreased, and stumbling corrective reactions remained relatively unchanged. We found redistribution of weight support after hemisection, with reduced diagonal supports and increased homolateral supports, particularly on the left contralesional side. The main neural strategy for complete clearance in intact cats consisted of increased knee flexor activation. After hemisection, ipsilesional knee flexor activation remained, but it was insufficient or more variable as the limb approached the obstacle. Intact cats also increased their speed when stepping over an obstacle, an increase that disappeared after hemisection. The increase in complete clearance over time after hemisection paralleled the recovery of muscle activation patterns or new strategies. Our results suggest partial recovery of anticipatory control through neuroplastic changes in the locomotor control system.","Following incomplete spinal cord injury in animals, including humans, substantial locomotor recovery can occur.

The decrease in complete clearance over time after hemisection diverged from the recovery of muscle activation patterns or new strategies. Our results suggest partial recovery of anticipatory control through neuroplastic changes in the locomotor control system.","Following incomplete spinal cord injury in animals, including humans, substantial locomotor recovery can occur. However, functional aspects of locomotion, such as negotiating obstacles, remains challenging. We collected kinematic and electromyography data in 10 adult cats (5 males, 5 females) before and at weeks 1-2 and 7-8 after a lateral mid-thoracic hemisection on the right side of the cord while they negotiated obstacles of three different heights. Intact cats always cleared obstacles without contact. At weeks 1-2 after hemisection, the ipsilesional right hindlimb contacted obstacles in â¼50% of trials, triggering a stumbling corrective reaction or absent responses, which we termed Other. When complete clearance occurred, we observed exaggerated ipsilesional hindlimb flexion when crossing the obstacle with contralesional Left limbs leading. At weeks 7-8 after hemisection, the proportion of complete clearance [[increased, decreased]], Other responses [[decreased, increased]], and stumbling corrective reactions remained relatively unchanged. We found redistribution of weight support after hemisection, with [[reduced, increased]] diagonal supports and [[increased, decreased]] homolateral supports, particularly on the [[left, right]] contralesional side. The main neural strategy for complete clearance in intact cats consisted of increased knee flexor activation.

Using a preference rating task, we investigated whether and how individual preferences for novel stimuli were influenced by others' preferences by manipulating others' social hierarchy and observational context. The behavioral results showed that human participants of both sexes were more likely to change their preferences to match those of a superior partner in a public than in a private context. fMRI data revealed distinct contributions of the subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to increased conformity to social hierarchy under observation. Specifically, the ventral mPFC showed increased activity when participants' preferences aligned with those of superior partners, regardless of behavioral manifestation. The rostral mPFC showed increased activity when conforming to a superior partner and nonconforming to an inferior one, indicating goal-dependent valuation. The dorsal mPFC showed increased activity in private conditions with a superior partner but only in those with a higher tendency to conform. These findings support the hierarchical allostatic regulation model of the mPFC function for social valuation and suggest strategic conformity as a way to minimize metabolic costs.","People often align their behaviors and decisions with others' expectations, especially those of higher social positions, when they are being observed.

However, previous studies failed to find consistent modulatory effects of taVNS on LC-NA biomarkers. Previous studies suggest that phasic taVNS may be capable of modulating LC-NA biomarkers such as pupil dilation and alpha oscillations. However, it is unclear whether these effects extend beyond pure sensory vagal nerve responses. Critically, the potential of the pupillary light reflex as an additional taVNS biomarker has not been explored so far. Here, we applied phasic active and sham taVNS in 29 subjects (16 female, 13 male) while they performed an emotional Stroop task (EST) and a passive pupil light reflex task (PLRT). We recorded pupil size and brain activity dynamics using a combined Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry design. Our results show that phasic taVNS significantly increased pupil dilation and performance during the EST. During the PLRT, active taVNS reduced and delayed pupil constriction. In the MEG, taVNS increased frontal-midline theta and alpha power during the EST, whereas occipital alpha power was reduced during both the EST and PLRT. Our findings provide evidence that phasic taVNS systematically modulates behavioral, pupillary, and electrophysiological parameters of LC-NA activity during cognitive processing. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the pupillary light reflex can be used as a simple and effective proxy of taVNS efficacy. These findings have important implications for the development of noninvasive neuromodulation interventions for various cognitive and clinical applications.","Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proposed to activate the locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system.

Rhythmic interactions, especially in the theta band, between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and limbic structures are thought to play an important role, but the ways in which memory processing occurs at a mechanistic and circuits level are largely unknown. To investigate how rhythmic interactions lead to fear extinction during REM sleep, we used a biophysically based model that included the infralimbic cortex (IL), a part of the mPFC with a critical role in suppressing fear memories. Theta frequency (4â12 Hz) inputs to a given cell assembly in IL, representing an emotional memory, resulted in the strengthening of connections from the IL to the amygdala and the weakening of connections from the amygdala to the IL, resulting in the suppression of the activity of fear expression cells for the associated memory. Lower frequency (4 Hz) theta inputs effected these changes over a wider range of input strengths. In contrast, inputs at other frequencies were ineffective at causing these synaptic changes and did not suppress fear memories. Under post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) REM sleep conditions, rhythmic activity dissipated, and 4 Hz theta inputs to IL were ineffective, but higher-frequency (10 Hz) theta inputs to IL induced changes similar to those seen with 4 Hz inputs under normal REM sleep conditions, resulting in the suppression of fear expression cells. These results suggest why PTSD patients may repeatedly experience the same emotionally charged dreams and suggest potential neuromodulatory therapies for the amelioration of PTSD symptoms.","REM sleep is important for the processing of emotional memories, including fear memories.

Here we examine the direct and indirect consequences of a delayed postnatal GABA shift on network development in organotypic hippocampal cultures made from 6- to 7-d-old mice by treating the cultures for 1 week with VU0463271, a specific inhibitor of the chloride exporter KCC2. We verified that VU treatment delayed the GABA shift and kept GABA signaling depolarizing until DIV9. We found that the structural and functional development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses at DIV9 was not affected after VU treatment. In line with previous studies, we observed that GABA signaling was already inhibitory in control and VU-treated postnatal slices. Surprisingly, 14 d after the VU treatment had ended (DIV21), we observed an increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal cells, while excitatory currents were not changed.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0156-23.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Models of visual cognition generally assume that brain networks predict the contents of a stimulus to facilitate its subsequent categorization. However, understanding prediction and categorization at a network level has remained challenging, partly because we need to reverse engineer their information processing mechanisms from the dynamic neural signals. Here, we used connectivity measures that can isolate the communications of a specific content to reconstruct these network mechanisms in each individual participant (N = 11, both sexes). Each was cued to the spatial location (left vs right) and contents [low spatial frequency (LSF) vs high spatial frequency (HSF)] of a predicted Gabor stimulus that they then categorized. Using each participant's concurrently measured MEG, we reconstructed networks that predict and categorize LSF versus HSF contents for behavior. We found that predicted contents flexibly propagate top down from temporal to lateralized occipital cortex, depending on task demands, under supervisory control of prefrontal cortex.

However, understanding prediction and categorization at a network level has remained challenging, partly because we need to reverse engineer their information processing mechanisms from the dynamic neural signals. Here, we used connectivity measures that can isolate the communications of a specific content to reconstruct these network mechanisms in each individual participant (N = 11, both sexes).

In the present study, we firstly identified two acidic amino acid residues that removed the pH-dependent activation of the hPAC channel by neutralization all the conservative negative charged residues located in the extracellular domain of the hPAC channel and some positively charged residues at the hotspot combined with two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) recording in the Xenopus oocytes system. Double-mutant cycle analysis and double cysteine mutant of these two residues proved that these two residues cooperatively form a proton-sensitive site. In addition, we found that chloral hydrate activates the hPAC channel depending on the normal pH sensitivity of the hPAC channel. Furthermore, the PAC channel knock-out (KO) male mice (C57BL/6J) resist chloral hydrate-induced sedation and hypnosis. Our study provides a molecular basis for understanding the proton-dependent activation mechanism of the hPAC channel and a novel drug target of chloral hydrate.","The transmembrane protein TMEM206 was recently identified as the molecular basis of the extracellular proton-activated Clâ channel (PAC), which plays an essential role in neuronal death in ischemia-reperfusion.

In the present study, we firstly identified two acidic amino acid residues that removed the pH-dependent activation of the hPAC channel by neutralization all the conservative negative charged residues located in the extracellular domain of the hPAC channel and some positively charged residues at the hotspot combined with two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) recording in the Xenopus oocytes system. Double-mutant cycle analysis and double cysteine mutant of these two residues proved that these two residues independently form a proton-sensitive site. In addition, we found that chloral hydrate activates the hPAC channel depending on the normal pH sensitivity of the hPAC channel. Furthermore, the PAC channel knock-out (KO) male mice (C57BL/6J) respond to chloral hydrate-induced sedation and hypnosis.

Mutations in Cullin 3 (CUL3), a core component of the Cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, have been associated with SZ and ASD. However, little is known about the function and mechanism of CUL3 in the DA system. Here, we show that CUL3 is critical for the function of DA neurons and DA-relevant behaviors in male mice. CUL3-deficient mice exhibited hyperactive locomotion, deficits in working memory and sensorimotor gating, and increased sensitivity to psychostimulants. In addition, enhanced DA signaling and elevated excitability of the VTA DA neurons were observed in CUL3-deficient animals. Behavioral impairments were attenuated by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol and chemogenetic inhibition of DA neurons. Furthermore, we identified HCN2, a hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, as a potential target of CUL3 in DA neurons. Our study indicates that CUL3 controls DA neuronal activity by maintaining ion channel homeostasis and provides insight into the role of CUL3 in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.","The dopaminergic neuromodulator system is fundamental to brain functions.

While multiple neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of body ownership and agency separately, few studies have investigated the relationship between these two aspects during voluntary movement when such experiences naturally combine. By eliciting the moving rubber hand illusion with active or passive finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated activations reflecting the sense of body ownership and agency, respectively, as well as their interaction, and assessed their overlap and anatomic segregation. We found that perceived hand ownership was associated with activity in premotor, posterior parietal, and cerebellar regions, whereas the sense of agency over the movements of the hand was related to activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and superior temporal cortex. Moreover, one section of the dorsal premotor cortex showed overlapping activity for ownership and agency, and somatosensory cortical activity reflected the interaction of ownership and agency with higher activity when both agency and ownership were experienced. We further found that activations previously attributed to agency in the left insular cortex and right temporoparietal junction reflected the synchrony or asynchrony of visuoproprioceptive stimuli rather than agency. Collectively, these results reveal the neural bases of agency and ownership during voluntary movement. Although the neural representations of these two experiences are largely distinct, there are interactions and functional neuroanatomical overlap during their combination, which has bearing on theories on bodily self-consciousness.","Body ownership and the sense of agency are two central aspects of bodily self-consciousness.

Can the proposed functional role of Î± and Î² oscillations be generalized from low-level operations to higher-level cognitive processes? Here we address this question focusing on naturalistic spoken language comprehension. Twenty-two (18 female) Dutch native speakers listened to stories in Dutch and French while MEG was recorded. We used dependency parsing to identify three dependency states at each word: the number of (1) newly opened dependencies, (2) dependencies that remained open, and (3) resolved dependencies. We then constructed forward models to predict Î± and Î² power from the dependency features. Results showed that dependency features predict Î± and Î² power in language-related regions beyond low-level linguistic features. Left temporal, fundamental language regions are involved in language comprehension in Î±, while frontal and parietal, higher-order language regions, and motor regions are involved in Î². Critically, Î±- and Î²-band dynamics seem to subserve language comprehension tapping into syntactic structure building and semantic composition by providing low-level mechanistic operations for inhibition and reactivation processes. Because of the temporal similarity of the Î±-Î² responses, their potential functional dissociation remains to be elucidated. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of Î± and Î² oscillations during naturalistic spoken language comprehension, providing evidence for the generalizability of these dynamics from perceptual to complex linguistic processes.","Brain oscillations are prevalent in all species and are involved in numerous perceptual operations.

In this study, we explored the neural mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. We conducted fMRI scanning of 34 right- and left-wing participants (45% females) watching political videos (e.g., campaign ads and political speeches) just before the elections in Israel. As expected, we observed significant differences between left- and right-wing participants in their interpretation of the videos' content. Furthermore, neuroimaging results revealed partisanship-dependent differences in activation and synchronization in higher-order regions. Surprisingly, such differences were also revealed in early sensory, motor, and somatosensory regions. We found that the political content synchronized the responses of primary visual and auditory cortices in a partisanship-dependent manner. Moreover, right-wing (and not left-wing) individuals' sensorimotor cortex was involved in processing right-wing (and not left-wing) political content. These differences were pronounced to the extent that we could predict political orientation from the early brain-response alone. Importantly, no such differences were found with respect to neutral content.

We demonstrated previously that the major cortical associative areas serving motion processing, like middle temporal complex (MT+), visual cortex area 6 (V6), and PIVC in adults, show selective responses to coherent flow in 8-week-old infants. Here, we study the BOLD response to the same motion stimuli in 5-week-old infants (four females and four males) and compare the maturation between these two ages. The results show that MT+ and PIVC areas show a similar motion response at 5 and 8 weeks, whereas response in the V6 shows a reduced BOLD response to motion at 5 weeks, and cuneus associative areas are not identifiable at this young age. In infants and in adults, primary visual cortex (V1) does not show a selectivity for coherent motion but shows very fast development between 5 and 8 weeks of age in response to the appearance of motion stimuli. Resting-state correlations demonstrate adult-like functional connectivity between the motion-selective associative areas but not between primary cortex and temporo-occipital and posterior-insular cortices. The results are consistent with a differential developmental trajectory of motion area respect to other occipital regions, probably reflecting also a different development trajectory of the central and peripheral visual field.","Behavioral studies suggest that motion perception is rudimentary at birth and matures steadily over the first few years.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1616-21.2022,Systems/Circuits,"Animal communication sounds exhibit complex temporal structure because of the amplitude fluctuations that comprise the sound envelope. In human speech, envelope modulations drive synchronized activity in auditory cortex (AC), which correlates strongly with comprehension (Giraud and Poeppel, 2012; Peelle and Davis, 2012; Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018). Studies of envelope coding in single neurons, performed in nonhuman animals, have focused on periodic amplitude modulation (AM) stimuli and use response metrics that are not easy to juxtapose with data from humans. In this study, we sought to bridge these fields. Specifically, we looked directly at the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking, and we assessed whether the apparent diversity across neurons' AM responses contributes to the population representation of speech-like sound envelopes. We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes. While AC neurons displayed heterogeneous tuning to AM rate, their temporal dynamics were stereotyped. Preferred response phases accumulated near the onsets of sinusoidal AM periods for slower rates (<8 Hz), and an over-representation of amplitude edges was apparent in population responses to both sinusoidal AM and vocoded speech envelopes. Crucially, this encoding bias imparted a decoding benefit: a classifier could discriminate vocoded speech stimuli using summed population activity, while higher frequency modulations required a more sophisticated decoder that tracked spiking responses from individual cells. Together, our results imply that the envelope structure relevant to parsing an acoustic stream could be read-out from a distributed, redundant population code.","Animal communication sounds exhibit complex temporal structure because of the amplitude fluctuations that comprise the sound envelope.

Previously, we uncovered neural populations selectively tuned to numerosities organized in a network of topographic maps in human association cortex. Here we investigate whether these numerosity maps are also involved in the processing of symbolic numbers, using 7T fMRI and a number-detection task.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1460-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Executive function (EF) is essential for humans to effectively engage in cognitively demanding tasks. In adults, EF is subserved by frontoparietal regions in the multiple demand (MD) network, which respond to various cognitively demanding tasks. However, children initially show poor EF and prolonged development. Do children recruit the same network as adults? Is it functionally and connectionally distinct from adjacent language cortex, as in adults? And is this activation or connectivity dependent on age or ability? We examine task-dependent (spatial working memory and passive language tasks) and resting state functional data in 44 adults (18-38 years, 68% female) and 37 children (4-12 years, 35% female). Subject-specific functional ROIs (ss-fROIs) show bilateral MD network activation in children. In both children and adults, these MD ss-fROIs are not recruited for linguistic processing and are connectionally distinct from language ss-fROIs. While MD activation was lower in children than in adults (even in motion- and performance-matched groups), both showed increasing MD activation with better performance, especially in right hemisphere ss-fROIs. We observe this relationship even when controlling for age, cross-sectionally and in a small longitudinal sample of children. These data suggest that the MD network is selective to cognitive demand in children, is distinct from adjacent language cortex, and increases in selectivity as performance improves. These findings show that neural structures subserving domain-general EF emerge early and are sensitive to ability even in children. This research advances understanding of how high-level human cognition emerges and could inform interventions targeting cognitive control.","Executive function (EF) is essential for humans to effectively engage in cognitively demanding tasks.

The nature and direction of such serial-dependence biases can differ between experimental settings; both attractive and repulsive biases toward previous stimuli have been observed. How and when these biases arise in the human brain remains largely unexplored. They could occur either via a change in sensory processing itself and/or during postperceptual processes such as maintenance or decision-making. To address this, we tested 20 participants (11 female) and analyzed behavioral and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data from a working-memory task in which participants were sequentially presented with two randomly oriented gratings, one of which was cued for recall at the end of the trial. Behavioral responses showed evidence for two distinct biases: (1) a within-trial repulsive bias away from the previously encoded orientation on the same trial, and (2) a between-trial attractive bias toward the task-relevant orientation on the previous trial. Multivariate classification of stimulus orientation revealed that neural representations during stimulus encoding were biased away from the previous grating orientation, regardless of whether we considered the within-trial or between-trial prior orientation, despite opposite effects on behavior. These results suggest that repulsive biases occur at the level of sensory processing and can be overridden at postperceptual stages to result in attractive biases in behavior.","Behavioral reports of sensory information are biased by stimulus history.

CSD is also thought to drive the headache phase in migraine by promoting the activation and mechanical sensitization of trigeminal primary afferent nociceptive neurons that innervate the cranial meninges. The factors underlying meningeal nociception in the wake of CSD remain poorly understood but potentially involve the parenchymal release of algesic mediators and damage-associated molecular patterns, particularly ATP. Here, we explored the role of ATP-P2X purinergic receptor signaling in mediating CSD-evoked meningeal afferent activation and mechanical sensitization. Male rats were subjected to a single CSD episode. In vivo, extracellular single-unit recording was used to measure meningeal afferent ongoing activity changes. Quantitative mechanical stimuli using a servomotor force-controlled stimulator assessed changes in the afferent's mechanosensitivity. Manipulation of meningeal P2X receptors was achieved via local administration of pharmacological agents. Broad-spectrum P2X receptor inhibition, selective blockade of the P2X7 receptor, and its related Pannexin 1 channel suppressed CSD-evoked afferent mechanical sensitization but did not affect the accompanying afferent activation response. Surprisingly, inhibition of the pronociceptive P2X2/3 receptor did not affect the activation or sensitization of meningeal afferents post-CSD. P2X7 signaling underlying afferent mechanosensitization was localized to the meninges and did not affect CSD susceptibility. We propose that meningeal P2X7 and Pannexin 1 signaling, potentially in meningeal macrophages or neutrophils, mediates the mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents, which contributes to migraine pain by exacerbating the headache during normally innocuous physical activities.","Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a key pathophysiological event that underlies visual and sensory auras in migraine.

We measured event-related potentials to investigate at which stages in the visual processing hierarchy these two types of object perception differed from one another. We found that semantically informed compared with uninformed perception was associated with larger amplitudes in the N170 component (150-200 ms), reduced amplitudes in the N400 component (400-700 ms), and a late decrease in alpha/beta band power. When the same objects were presented once more without any information, the N400 and event-related power effects persisted, and we also observed increased amplitudes in the P1 component (100-150 ms) in response to objects for which semantically informed perception had taken place. Consistent with previous work, this suggests that obtaining semantic information about previously unfamiliar objects alters aspects of their lower-level visual perception (P1 component), higher-level visual perception (N170 component), and semantic processing (N400 component, event-related power).

We found a deviance distraction effect on the animals' performance: Faster reaction times but worsened target detection was observed in the presence of a deviant stimulus. Multiunit activity and local field potentials exhibited enhanced neuronal responses to deviant compared with standard whisker stimuli across all cortical layers, as a result of SSA. The deviant-triggered behavioral distraction correlated with these enhanced neuronal deviant responses only in the deeper cortical layers.

These results demonstrate a layer-specific involvement of SSA on perception that is susceptible to modulation over time.","Automatic detection of a surprising change in the sensory input is a central element of exogenous attentional control. Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is a potential neuronal mechanism detecting such changes and has been robustly described across sensory modalities and different instances of the ascending sensory pathways. However, little is known about the relationship of SSA to perception. To assess how deviating stimuli influence target signal detection, we used a behavioral cross-modal paradigm in mice and combined it with extracellular recordings from the primary somatosensory whisker cortex. In this paradigm, male mice performed a visual detection task while task-irrelevant whisker stimuli were either presented as repetitive âstandardâ or as rare deviant stimuli. We found a deviance distraction effect on the animals' performance: [[Faster, Slower]] reaction times but [[worsened, improved]] target detection was observed in the presence of a deviant stimulus. Multiunit activity and local field potentials exhibited enhanced neuronal responses to deviant compared with standard whisker stimuli across all cortical layers, as a result of SSA. The deviant-triggered behavioral distraction correlated with these enhanced neuronal deviant responses only in the [[deeper, shallower]] cortical layers. However, the layer-specific effect of SSA on perception reduced with increasing task experience as a result of statistical distractor learning. These results demonstrate a layer-specific involvement of SSA on perception that is susceptible to modulation over time."

Inactivation of the prelimbic (PL) cortex has revealed its integral role in updating decision biases in the face of changes in probabilistic reward contingencies, yet how phasic PL signals during different phases of the decision process influence choice remains unclear. We used temporally specific optogenetic inhibition to selectively disrupt PL activity coinciding with action selection and outcome phases to examine how these signals influence choice. Male rats expressing the inhibitory opsin eArchT within PL excitatory neurons were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task, entailing choice between small/certain versus large/risky rewards, the probability of which varied over a session (50â12.5%). During testing, brief light pulses suppressed PL activity before choice or after different outcomes. Prechoice suppression reduced bias toward more preferred/higher utility options and disrupted how recent outcomes influenced subsequent choice. Inhibition during risky losses induced a similar profile, but here, the impact of reward omissions were either amplified or diminished, relative to the context of the estimated profitability of the risky option. Inhibition during large or small reward receipt reduced risky choice when this option was more profitable, suggesting these signals can both reinforce rewarded risky choices and also act as a relative value comparator signal that augments incentive for larger rewards. These findings reveal multifaceted contributions by the PL in implementing decisions and integrating actionâoutcome feedback to assign context to the decision space.","Risk/reward decision-making is a dynamic process that includes periods of deliberation before action selection and evaluation of the action outcomes that bias subsequent choices.
