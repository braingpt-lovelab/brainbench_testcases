We developed a spatial decision-making task in which male rats learned to navigate a multiarm maze to a goal location for food reward while avoiding maze arms in which aversive stimuli were delivered. Task learning induced partial remapping in CA1 place cells, allowing us to identify both remapping and stable cell populations. Remapping cells were recruited into sharp-wave ripples and associated replay events to a greater extent than stable cells, despite having similar firing rates during navigation of the maze. Our results suggest that recruitment into replay events may be a mechanism to incorporate new contextual information into a previously formed and stabilized spatial representation.","Study of the hippocampal place cell system has greatly enhanced our understanding of memory encoding for distinct places, but how episodic memories for distinct experiences occurring within familiar environments are encoded is less clear.

It is organized in an anterior-posterior global gradient where posterior regions track changes in the environment while anterior regions support abstract neural representations. However, it remains unknown if such a global gradient results from a smooth gradient that spans regions, or an emergent property arising from functionally distinct regions, i.e. an areal gradient. Here, we recorded single-neurons in the dlPFC of non-human primates trained to perform a memory-guided saccade task with an interfering distractor, and analyzed their physiological properties along the anterior-posterior axis. We found that these physiological properties were best described by an areal gradient. Further, population analyses revealed that there is a distributed representation of spatial information across the dlPFC. Our results validate the functional boundaries between anatomically-defined dlPFC regions and highlight the distributed nature of computations underlying working memory across the dlPFC.","The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is composed of multiple anatomically defined regions involved in higher-order cognitive processes, including working memory and selective attention.

However, it is unclear to what extent age-related declines in NE functioning in humans affect reward-based decision-making. We conducted a probabilistic decision-making task and applied a Q-learning model to investigate participants’ anticipatory values and value sensitivities. Task-related pupil dilations and locus coeruleus (LC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast, which served as a potential window of the LC-NE functions, were assessed in younger and older adults. Results showed that in both choice and feedback phases, younger adults’ (N = 42, 22 males) pupil dilations negatively correlated with anticipatory values, indicating uncertainty about outcome probabilities. Uncertainty-evoked pupil dilations in older adults (N = 41, 27 males) were smaller, indicating age-related impairments in value estimation and updating. In both age groups, participants who showed a larger uncertainty-evoked pupil dilation exhibited a higher value sensitivity as reflected in the β parameter of the reinforcement Q-learning model. Furthermore, older adults (N = 34, 29 males) showed a lower LC-MRI contrast than younger adults (N = 25, 15 males). The LC-MRI contrast positively correlated with value sensitivity only in older but not in younger adults.

However, it remains unclear how the prior knowledge is maintained in our brains and thereby influences the subsequent conscious perception. The Dalmatian dog illusion is a perfect tool to study prior knowledge, where the picture is initially perceived as noise. Once the prior knowledge was introduced, a Dalmatian dog could be consciously seen, and the picture immediately became meaningful. Using pictures with hidden objects as standard stimuli and similar pictures without hidden objects as deviant stimuli, we investigated the neural representation of prior knowledge and its impact on conscious perception in an oddball paradigm using electroencephalogram (EEG) in both male and female human subjects. We found that the neural patterns between the prestimulus alpha band oscillations and poststimulus EEG activity were significantly more similar for the standard stimuli than for the deviant stimuli after prior knowledge was provided. Furthermore, decoding analysis revealed that persistent neural templates were evoked after the introduction of prior knowledge, similar to that evoked in the early stages of visual processing. In conclusion, the current study suggests that prior knowledge uses alpha band oscillations in a multivariate manner in the prestimulus period and induces specific persistent neural templates in the poststimulus period, enabling the conscious perception of the hidden objects.","Prior knowledge has a profound impact on the way we perceive the world.

However, understanding prediction and categorization at a network level has remained challenging, partly because we need to reverse engineer their information processing mechanisms from the dynamic neural signals. Here, we used connectivity measures that can isolate the communications of a specific content to reconstruct these network mechanisms in each individual participant (N = 11, both sexes). Each was cued to the spatial location (left vs right) and contents [low spatial frequency (LSF) vs high spatial frequency (HSF)] of a predicted Gabor stimulus that they then categorized. Using each participant's concurrently measured MEG, we reconstructed networks that predict and categorize LSF versus HSF contents for behavior. We found that predicted contents flexibly propagate top down from temporal to lateralized occipital cortex, depending on task demands, under supervisory control of prefrontal cortex. When they reach lateralized occipital cortex, predictions enhance the bottom-up LSF versus HSF representations of the stimulus, all the way from occipital-ventral-parietal to premotor cortex, in turn producing faster categorization behavior. Importantly, content communications are subsets (i.e., 55–75%) of the signal-to-signal communications typically measured between brain regions. Hence, our study isolates functional networks that process the information of cognitive functions.","Models of visual cognition generally assume that brain networks predict the contents of a stimulus to facilitate its subsequent categorization.

However, motion is another cue that could be used by the visual system to classify objects. To determine how motion-defined object category information is processed by the brain in the absence of luminance-defined form information, we created a novel stimulus set of “object kinematograms” to isolate motion-defined signals from other sources of visual information. Object kinematograms were generated by extracting motion information from videos of 6 object categories and applying the motion to limited-lifetime random dot patterns. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 15, 40% women), we investigated whether category information from the object kinematograms could be decoded within the occipitotemporal and parietal cortex and evaluated whether the information overlapped with category responses to static images from the original videos. We decoded object category for both stimulus formats in all higher-order regions of interest (ROIs). More posterior occipitotemporal and ventral regions showed higher accuracy in the static condition, while more anterior occipitotemporal and dorsal regions showed higher accuracy in the dynamic condition. Further, decoding across the two stimulus formats was possible in all regions. These results demonstrate that motion cues can elicit widespread and robust category responses on par with those elicited by static luminance cues, even in ventral regions of visual cortex that have traditionally been associated with primarily image-defined form processing.","Humans can label and categorize objects in a visual scene with high accuracy and speed, a capacity well characterized with studies using static images.

However, previous studies did not consider the relationship between sulcal morphology and cognitive development in individual participants.

Manually defining thousands of sulci revealed that LPFC sulcal morphology (depth, surface area, and gray matter thickness) differed between children (6-11 years old)/adolescents (11-18 years old) and young adults (22-36 years old) cross-sectionally, but only cortical thickness showed differences across childhood and adolescence and presented longitudinal changes during childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, a data-driven approach relating morphology and cognition identified that longitudinal changes in cortical thickness of four left-hemisphere LPFC sulci predicted longitudinal changes in reasoning performance, a higher-level cognitive ability that relies on LPFC. Contrary to previous findings, these results suggest that sulci may flatten either after this time frame or over a longer longitudinal period of time than previously presented.

These implications are commonly investigated in either pavlovian or operant reinforcement paradigms, where only the latter requires instrumental action. To parse contributions of reward- and action-related information to dopamine signals, we directly compared the two paradigms: male rats underwent either pavlovian or operant conditioning while dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region central for processing this information. Task conditions were identical with the exception of the operant-lever response requirement. Rats in both groups released the same quantity of dopamine at the onset of the reward-predictive cue. However, only the operant-conditioning group showed a subsequent, sustained plateau in dopamine concentration throughout the entire 5 s cue presentation (preceding the required action). This dopamine ramp was unaffected by probabilistic reward delivery, occurred exclusively before operant actions, and was not related to task performance or task acquisition as it persisted throughout the 2 week daily behavioral training. Instead, the ramp flexibly increased in duration with longer cue presentation, seemingly modulating the initial cue-onset-triggered dopamine release, that is, the reward prediction error (RPE) signal, as both signal amplitude and sustainment diminished when reward timing was made more predictable. Thus, our findings suggest that RPE and action components of dopamine release can be differentiated temporally into phasic and ramping/sustained signals, respectively, where the latter depends on the former and presumably reflects the anticipation or incentivization of appetitive action, conceptually akin to motivation.","The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in signaling reward-related information as well as in actions that generate rewarding outcomes.

We present a network model describing how the brain represents the semantic dependency relations among traits and uses this information to avoid an overall loss of positivity and coherence. Both male and female human participants received social feedback during a self-evaluation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We modeled self-belief updating by incorporating a reinforcement learning model within the network structure. Participants learned more rapidly from positive than negative feedback and were less likely to change self-views for traits with more dependencies in the network. Further, participants back propagated feedback across network relations while retrieving prior feedback on the basis of network similarity to inform ongoing self-views. Activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) reflected the constrained updating process such that positive feedback led to higher activation and negative feedback to less activation for traits with more dependencies. Additionally, vmPFC was associated with the novelty of a trait relative to previously self-evaluated traits in the network, and angular gyrus was associated with greater certainty for self-beliefs given the relevance of prior feedback. We propose that neural computations that selectively enhance or attenuate social feedback and retrieve past relevant experiences to guide ongoing self-evaluations may support an overall positive and coherent self-concept.","People experience instances of social feedback as interdependent with potential implications for their entire self-concept.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0148-22.2022,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging. Using fMRI, fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and impairment following focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience data, a large, population-based cohort of healthy males and females across the adult lifespan. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localize the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodeled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. An additional moderating role of the variety of nonphysical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.","Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging.

However, despite their ability to explain a significant portion of variance in neural data, the agreement between models and brain representational dynamics is far from perfect. We address this issue by asking which representational features are currently unaccounted for in neural time series data, estimated for multiple areas of the ventral stream via source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography data acquired in human participants (nine females, six males) during object viewing. We focus on the ability of visuo-semantic models, consisting of human-generated labels of object features and categories, to explain variance beyond the explanatory power of DNNs alone. We report a gradual reversal in the relative importance of DNN versus visuo-semantic features as ventral-stream object representations unfold over space and time. Although lower-level visual areas are better explained by DNN features starting early in time (at 66 ms after stimulus onset), higher-level cortical dynamics are best accounted for by visuo-semantic features starting later in time (at 146 ms after stimulus onset). Among the visuo-semantic features, object parts and basic categories drive the advantage over DNNs. These results show that a significant component of the variance unexplained by DNNs in higher-level cortical dynamics is structured and can be explained by readily nameable aspects of the objects. We conclude that current DNNs fail to fully capture dynamic representations in higher-level human visual cortex and suggest a path toward more accurate models of ventral-stream computations.","Deep neural networks (DNNs) are promising models of the cortical computations supporting human object recognition.

While multiple neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of body ownership and agency separately, few studies have investigated the relationship between these two aspects during voluntary movement when such experiences naturally combine. By eliciting the moving rubber hand illusion with active or passive finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated activations reflecting the sense of body ownership and agency, respectively, as well as their interaction, and assessed their overlap and anatomic segregation. We found that perceived hand ownership was associated with activity in premotor, posterior parietal, and cerebellar regions, whereas the sense of agency over the movements of the hand was related to activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and superior temporal cortex. Moreover, one section of the dorsal premotor cortex showed overlapping activity for ownership and agency, and somatosensory cortical activity reflected the interaction of ownership and agency with higher activity when both agency and ownership were experienced. We further found that activations previously attributed to agency in the left insular cortex and right temporoparietal junction reflected the synchrony or asynchrony of visuoproprioceptive stimuli rather than agency. Collectively, these results reveal the neural bases of agency and ownership during voluntary movement. Although the neural representations of these two experiences are largely distinct, there are interactions and functional neuroanatomical overlap during their combination, which has bearing on theories on bodily self-consciousness.","Body ownership and the sense of agency are two central aspects of bodily self-consciousness.

As expected, we observed significant differences between left- and right-wing participants in their interpretation of the videos' content.

Surprisingly, such differences were also revealed in early sensory, motor, and somatosensory regions. We found that the political content synchronized the responses of primary visual and auditory cortices in a partisanship-dependent manner. Moreover, right-wing (and not left-wing) individuals' sensorimotor cortex was involved in processing right-wing (and not left-wing) political content. These differences were pronounced to the extent that we could predict political orientation from the early brain-response alone. Importantly, no such differences were found with respect to neutral content.

Animal models suggest that interactions between the dopamine (DA) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may modulate learning and reward-related processes. The present study therefore examined the behavioral and neural effects of the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan on social reward and punishment processing in humans. A preregistered randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subject pharmacological design was combined with a social incentive delay (SID) functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm during which subjects could avoid social punishment or gain social reward. Healthy volunteers received a single-dose of losartan (50 mg, n = 43, female = 17) or placebo (n = 44, female = 20). We evaluated reaction times (RTs) and emotional ratings as behavioral and activation and functional connectivity as neural outcomes. Relative to placebo, losartan modulated the reaction time and arousal differences between social punishment and social reward. On the neural level the losartan-enhanced motivational salience of social rewards was accompanied by stronger ventral striatum-prefrontal connectivity during reward anticipation. Losartan increased the reward-neutral difference in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and attenuated VTA associated connectivity with the bilateral insula in response to punishment during the outcome phase. Thus, losartan modulated approach-avoidance motivation and emotional salience during social punishment versus social reward via modulating distinct core nodes of the midbrain-striato-frontal circuits. The findings document a modulatory role of the renin-angiotensin system in these circuits and associated social processes, suggesting a promising treatment target to alleviate social dysregulations.","Social deficits and dysregulations in dopaminergic midbrain-striato-frontal circuits represent transdiagnostic symptoms across psychiatric disorders.

Orienting responses may be important to evaluate stimuli that call for action (e.g., approach, escape, ignore), but little is known about the dynamics of orienting responses in the context of goal-directed actions. Using mice of either sex, we found that, during a signaled avoidance action, the orienting response evoked by the conditioned stimulus (CS) consisted of a fast head movement containing rotational and translational components that varied substantially as a function of the behavioral and underlying brain states of the animal set by different task contingencies. Larger CS-evoked orienting responses were associated with high-intensity auditory stimuli, failures to produce the appropriate signaled action, and behavioral states resulting from uncertain or demanding situations and the animal's ability to cope with them. As a prototypical orienting neural circuit, we confirmed that the superior colliculus controls and codes the direction of spontaneous exploratory orienting movements. In addition, superior colliculus activity correlated with CS-evoked orienting responses, and either its optogenetic inhibition or excitation potentiated CS-evoked orienting responses, which are likely generated downstream in the medulla. CS-evoked orienting responses may be a useful probe to assess behavioral and related brain states, and state-dependent modulation of orienting responses may involve the superior colliculus.","Sensory stimuli can trigger an orienting reflex (response) by which animals move the head to position their sensors (e.g., eyes, pinna, whiskers).

In addition, superior colliculus activity correlated with CS-evoked orienting responses, and either its optogenetic inhibition or excitation potentiated CS-evoked orienting responses, which are likely generated downstream in the medulla. CS-evoked orienting responses may be a useful probe to assess behavioral and related brain states, and state-dependent modulation of orienting responses may involve the superior colliculus.","Sensory stimuli can trigger an orienting reflex (response) by which animals move the head to position their sensors (e.g., eyes, pinna, whiskers). Orienting responses may be important to evaluate stimuli that call for action (e.g., approach, escape, ignore), but little is known about the dynamics of orienting responses in the context of goal-directed actions. Using mice of either sex, we found that, during a signaled avoidance action, the orienting response evoked by the conditioned stimulus (CS) consisted of a fast head movement containing rotational and translational components that varied substantially as a function of the behavioral and underlying brain states of the animal set by different task contingencies.

RPE signals are encoded in the neural activity of multiple brain areas, such as midbrain dopaminergic neurons, prefrontal cortex, and striatum. However, it remains unclear how these signals are expressed through anatomically and functionally distinct subregions of the striatum. In the current study, we examined to which extent RPE signals are represented across different striatal regions. To do so, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic striatal territories of two male rhesus monkeys performing a free-choice probabilistic learning task. The trial-by-trial evolution of RPE during task performance was estimated using a reinforcement learning model fitted on monkeys' choice behavior. Overall, we found that changes in beta band oscillations (15–35 Hz), after the outcome of the animal's choice, are consistent with RPE encoding. Moreover, we provide evidence that the signals related to RPE are more strongly represented in the ventral (limbic) than dorsal (sensorimotor and associative) part of the striatum.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1332-22.2022,Behavioral/Cognitive,"A common problem in motor control concerns how to generate patterns of muscle activity when there are redundant solutions to attain a behavioral goal. Optimal feedback control is a theory that has guided many behavioral studies exploring how the motor system incorporates task redundancy. This theory predicts that kinematic errors that deviate the limb should not be corrected if one can still attain the behavioral goal. Studies in humans demonstrate that the motor system can flexibly integrate visual and proprioceptive feedback of the limb with goal redundancy within 90 ms and 70 ms, respectively. Here, we show monkeys (Macaca mulatta) demonstrate similar abilities to exploit goal redundancy. We trained four male monkeys to reach for a goal that was either a narrow square or a wide, spatially redundant rectangle. Monkeys exhibited greater trial-by-trial variability when reaching to the wide goal consistent with exploiting goal redundancy. On random trials we jumped the visual feedback of the hand and found monkeys corrected for the jump when reaching to the narrow goal and largely ignored the jump when reaching for the wide goal. In a separate set of experiments, we applied mechanical loads to the arm of the monkey and found similar corrective responses based on goal shape. Muscle activity reflecting these different corrective responses were detected for the visual and mechanical perturbations starting at ∼90 and ∼70 ms, respectively. Thus, rapid motor responses in macaques can exploit goal redundancy similar to humans, creating a paradigm to study the neural basis of goal-directed motor action and motor redundancy.","A common problem in motor control concerns how to generate patterns of muscle activity when there are redundant solutions to attain a behavioral goal. Optimal feedback control is a theory that has guided many behavioral studies exploring how the motor system incorporates task redundancy.

However, no preclinical studies have examined the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon. To assess this, in vivo electrophysiology was used in Long Evans male and female rats during a DT task to record neural activity in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), a brain region implicated in drug-seeking. Rats were first assessed for DT, defined as the amount of time elapsed before rats quit seeking reward in an increasingly difficult operant task. Subsequently, rats underwent 2 weeks of self-administration for either water/saline or cocaine for 6 h/day. Animals then began a 1 month period of experimenter-imposed abstinence to induce heightened drug-seeking behavior. On day 28 of abstinence, DT and neural activity were reassessed; and on day 30, cocaine-seeking behavior was examined under extinction. Males had significantly higher DT than females and exhibited significantly more phasic PrL activity during the DT task. Furthermore, in male rats with a history of cocaine, PrL activity shifted to track DT; and this change in activity significantly correlated with the change in DT. Additionally, male (but not female) rats with low DT after 28 d of abstinence had significantly heightened drug-seeking behavior. Finally, PrL activity during the DT task predicted cocaine-seeking behavior. Collectively, these data demonstrate an important role for the PrL in DT in males, and link this neural activity and behavior to drug-seeking, particularly in males.","Distress tolerance (DT) is defined as the ability to persist in challenging goal-directed behavior in the face of stress, and individuals with low DT exhibit heightened drug-seeking behavior.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are critical for reinforcement, and their activation is sufficient for learning about cues, actions, and outcomes. Here we examine in detail the mechanisms underlying the ability of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) dopamine neurons to support instrumental learning. By exploiting numerous behavioral tasks in combination with time-limited optogenetic manipulations in male and female rats, we reveal that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons generate reinforcement through separable psychological processes. VTA dopamine neurons imbue actions and their associated cues with motivational value that allows flexible and persistent pursuit, whereas SNc dopamine neurons support time-limited, precise, action-specific learning that is nonscalable and inflexible. This architecture is reminiscent of actor–critic reinforcement learning models with VTA and SNc instructing the critic and actor, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterogeneous dopamine systems support unique forms of instrumental learning that ultimately result in disparate reward-seeking strategies.","Reward seeking requires the coordination of motor programs to achieve goals.

However, children initially show poor EF and prolonged development. Do children recruit the same network as adults? Is it functionally and connectionally distinct from adjacent language cortex, as in adults? And is this activation or connectivity dependent on age or ability? We examine task-dependent (spatial working memory and passive language tasks) and resting state functional data in 44 adults (18-38 years, 68% female) and 37 children (4-12 years, 35% female). Subject-specific functional ROIs (ss-fROIs) show bilateral MD network activation in children. In both children and adults, these MD ss-fROIs are not recruited for linguistic processing and are connectionally distinct from language ss-fROIs. While MD activation was lower in children than in adults (even in motion- and performance-matched groups), both showed increasing MD activation with better performance, especially in right hemisphere ss-fROIs. We observe this relationship even when controlling for age, cross-sectionally and in a small longitudinal sample of children. These data suggest that the MD network is selective to cognitive demand in children, is distinct from adjacent language cortex, and increases in selectivity as performance improves. These findings show that neural structures subserving domain-general EF emerge early and are sensitive to ability even in children.

Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that were modulated by the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented, the identity of the specific environment being recalled.

Adapted motor plans are consolidated into memories that contribute to better performance on re-exposure. Consolidation begins within 15 min following training (Criscimagna-Hemminger and Shadmehr, 2008), and can be measured via changes in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC). For dynamic adaptation, rsFC has not been quantified on this timescale, nor has its relationship to adaptative behavior been established. We used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-compatible robot, the MR-SoftWrist (Erwin et al., 2017), to quantify rsFC specific to dynamic adaptation of wrist movements and subsequent memory formation in a mixed-sex cohort of human participants. We acquired fMRI during a motor execution and a dynamic adaptation task to localize brain networks of interest, and quantified rsFC within these networks in three 10-min windows occurring immediately before and after each task. The next day, we assessed behavioral retention. We used a mixed model of rsFC measured in each time window to identify changes in rsFC with task performance, and linear regression to identify the relationship between rsFC and behavior. Following the dynamic adaptation task, rsFC increased within the cortico-cerebellar network and decreased interhemispherically within the cortical sensorimotor network. Increases within the cortico-cerebellar network were specific to dynamic adaptation, as they were associated with behavioral measures of adaptation and retention, indicating that this network has a functional role in consolidation. Instead, decreases in rsFC within the cortical sensorimotor network were associated with motor control processes independent from adaptation and retention.","Dynamic adaptation is an error-driven process of adjusting planned motor actions to changes in task dynamics (Shadmehr, 2017).

We used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-compatible robot, the MR-SoftWrist (Erwin et al., 2017), to quantify rsFC specific to dynamic adaptation of wrist movements and subsequent memory formation in a mixed-sex cohort of human participants. We acquired fMRI during a motor execution and a dynamic adaptation task to localize brain networks of interest, and quantified rsFC within these networks in three 10-min windows occurring immediately before and after each task. The next day, we assessed behavioral retention. We used a mixed model of rsFC measured in each time window to identify changes in rsFC with task performance, and linear regression to identify the relationship between rsFC and behavior. Following the dynamic adaptation task, rsFC decreased within the cortico-cerebellar network and increased interhemispherically within the cortical sensorimotor network. Decreases within the cortico-cerebellar network were specific to dynamic adaptation, as they were associated with behavioral measures of adaptation and retention, indicating that this network has a functional role in consolidation. Instead, increases in rsFC within the cortical sensorimotor network were associated with motor control processes independent from adaptation and retention.","Dynamic adaptation is an error-driven process of adjusting planned motor actions to changes in task dynamics (Shadmehr, 2017).

Here, we explored human brains of both men and women, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to find such support by relating the brain signals of sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating to human classification behavior. We found that the stimulus-encoding signal in the early visual cortex adapted to previous stimuli, yet its adaptation-related changes were dissociated from current choices. Contrastingly, the boundary-representing signals in the inferior-parietal and superior-temporal cortices shifted to previous stimuli and covaried with current choices. Our exploration points to boundary-updating, rather than sensory-adaptation, as the origin of the repulsive bias in binary classification.","Binary classification, an act of sorting items into two classes by setting a boundary, is biased by recent history.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1418-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Cognition and brain structure undergo significant maturation from adolescence into adulthood. Model-based (MB) control is known to increase across development, which is mediated by cognitive abilities. Here, we asked two questions unaddressed in previous developmental studies. First, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Second, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A human developmental sample (n = 103; age, 12–50, male/female, 55:48) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive versus negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that gray matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. Although motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in positive feedback learning was mediated by reduced GMD in the parietal, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that brain maturation, putatively reflected in lower GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions could lead to a more efficient brain organization and might thus be a key developmental step toward age-related increases in planning and value-based choice.","Cognition and brain structure undergo significant maturation from adolescence into adulthood.

Neural representation of USVs in the mouse primary auditory cortex (Au1) and its plasticity with experience has been largely studied with single-syllables or dyads, without using the predictability in USV sequences. Studies using playback of USV sequences have used randomly selected sequences from numerous possibilities. The current study uses mutual-information to obtain context-specific natural sequences of USV syllables (NSeq) capturing the observed predictability in male USVs in different contexts of social interaction with females. Behavioral and physiological significance of NSeqs over random sequences (RSeq) lacking predictability were examined. Female mice, never having the social experience of being exposed to males, showed higher selectivity for NSeqs behaviorally and at cellular levels probed by expression of immediate early gene c-fos in Au1. The Au1 supragranular single-units also showed higher selectivity to NSeq over RSeq. Social experience-driven plasticity in encoding NSeq and RSeq in adult females was probed by examining neural selectivities to the same sequences before and after the above social experience. Single-units showed enhanced selectivity for NSeq over RSeq after the social experience. Further, using 2-photon Ca2+ imaging, we observed social experience dependent changes in the selectivity of sequences of excitatory and somatostatin-positive inhibitory neurons but not parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons of Au1. Using optogenetics, somatostatin-positive neurons were identified as a possible mediator of the observed social experience driven plasticity. Our study uncovers the importance of predictive sequences and introduces mouse USVs as a promising model to study context-dependent speech like communications.","Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) contain predictable sequential structures like bird-songs and speech.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1609-22.2022,Systems/Circuits,"In the macaque monkey, area V6A, located in the medial posterior parietal cortex, contains cells that encode the spatial position of a reaching target. It has been suggested that during reach planning this information is sent to the frontal cortex along a parieto-frontal pathway that connects V6A–premotor cortex–M1. A similar parieto-frontal network may also exist in the human brain, and we aimed here to study the timing of this functional connection during planning of a reaching movement toward different spatial positions. We probed the functional connectivity between human area V6A (hV6A) and the primary motor cortex (M1) using dual-site, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with a short (4 ms) and a longer (10 ms) interstimulus interval while healthy participants (18 men and 18 women) planned a visually-guided or a memory-guided reaching movement toward positions located at different depths and directions. We found that, when the stimulation over hV6A is sent 4 ms before the stimulation over M1, hV6A inhibits motor-evoked potentials during planning of either rightward or leftward reaching movements. No modulations were found when the stimulation over hV6A was sent 10 ms before the stimulation over M1, suggesting that only short medial parieto-frontal routes are active during reach planning. Moreover, the short route of hV6A–premotor cortex–M1 is active during reach planning irrespectively of the nature (visual or memory) of the reaching target. These results agree with previous neuroimaging studies and provide the first demonstration of the flow of inhibitory signals between hV6A and M1.","In the macaque monkey, area V6A, located in the medial posterior parietal cortex, contains cells that encode the spatial position of a reaching target. It has been suggested that during reach planning this information is sent to the frontal cortex along a parieto-frontal pathway that connects V6A–premotor cortex–M1.

Here, we examined how the primate vestibular system, independently and in combination with visual sensory input, contributes to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the range of dynamic motion experienced during daily life. We recorded activity of single motor units in the splenius capitis and sternocleidomastoid muscles in rhesus monkeys during yaw rotations spanning the physiological range of self-motion (up to 20 Hz) in darkness. Splenius capitis motor unit responses continued to increase with frequency up to 16 Hz in normal animals, and were strikingly absent following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. To determine whether visual information modulated these vestibular-driven neck muscle responses, we experimentally controlled the correspondence between visual and vestibular cues of self-motion. Surprisingly, visual information did not influence motor unit responses in normal animals, nor did it substitute for absent vestibular feedback following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. A comparison of muscle activity evoked by broadband versus sinusoidal head motion further revealed that low-frequency responses were attenuated when low- and high-frequency self-motion were experienced concurrently. Finally, we found that vestibular-evoked responses were enhanced by increased autonomic arousal, quantified via pupil size. Together, our findings directly establish the vestibular system's contribution to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the dynamic motion range experienced during everyday activities, as well as how vestibular, visual, and autonomic inputs are integrated for postural control.","To maintain stable posture of the head and body during our everyday activities, the brain integrates information across multiple sensory systems.

Previous work has indicated that both the insular cortex and dynorphin (DYN)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) systems contribute to excessive alcohol use. More recently, we identified a microcircuit in the medial aspect of the insular cortex that signals through DYN/KOR. Here, we explored the role of insula DYN/KOR circuit components on alcohol intake in a long-term intermittent access (IA) procedure. Using a combination of conditional knock-out strategies and site-directed pharmacology, we discovered distinct and sex-specific roles for insula DYN and KOR in alcohol drinking and related behavior. Our findings show that insula DYN deletion blocked escalated consumption and decreased the overall intake of and preference for alcohol in male and female mice. This effect was specific to alcohol in male mice, as DYN deletion did not impact sucrose intake. Further, insula KOR antagonism reduced alcohol intake and preference during the early phase of IA in male mice only. Alcohol consumption was not affected by insula KOR knockout in either sex. In addition, we found that long-term IA decreased the intrinsic excitability of DYN and deep layer pyramidal neurons (DLPNs) in the insula of male mice. Excitatory synaptic transmission was also impacted by IA, as it drove an increase in excitatory synaptic drive in both DYN neurons and DLPNs.

Consistently, chemogenetic activation of PVT MC3R neurons [[increases, decreases]] anxiety-related behavior and [[reduces, increases]] feeding in hungry mice, while inhibition of PVT MC3R neurons [[reduces, increases]] anxiety-related behavior. These studies position PVT MC3R neurons as important cellular substrates linking energy status with neural circuitry regulating anxiety-related behavior and represent a promising potential target for diseases at the intersection of metabolism and anxiety-related behavior such as anorexia nervosa."

Within these circuits, neuronal ensembles, which represent subnetworks with shared functional connectivity, emerge in an experience-dependent manner. Here we induced ensembles in ex vivo cortical circuits from mice of either sex by differentially activating subpopulations through chronic optogenetic stimulation. We observed a decrease in voltage correlation, and importantly a synaptic decoupling between the stimulated and nonstimulated populations. We also observed a decrease in firing rate during Up-states in the stimulated population. These ensemble-specific changes were accompanied by decreases in intrinsic excitability in the stimulated population, and a decrease in connectivity between stimulated and nonstimulated pyramidal neurons. By incorporating the empirically observed changes in intrinsic excitability and connectivity into a spiking neural network model, we were able to demonstrate that changes in both intrinsic excitability and connectivity accounted for the decreased firing rate, but only changes in connectivity accounted for the observed decorrelation. Our findings help ascertain the mechanisms underlying the ability of chronic patterned stimulation to create ensembles within cortical circuits and, importantly, show that while Up-states are a global network-wide phenomenon, functionally distinct ensembles can preserve their identity during Up-states through differential firing rates and correlations.","Cortical computations emerge from the dynamics of neurons embedded in complex cortical circuits.

We investigated the relationship between pupil diameter and blink rate with neural activity and blood volume in the somatosensory cortex in male and female unanesthetized, head-fixed mice. We monitored these variables while the mice were awake, during periods of rapid eye movement (REM), and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Pupil diameter was smaller during sleep than in the awake state. Changes in pupil diameter were coherent with both gamma-band power and blood volume in the somatosensory cortex, but the strength and sign of this relationship varied with arousal state. We observed a strong negative correlation between pupil diameter and both gamma-band power and blood volume during periods of awake rest and NREM sleep, although the correlations between pupil diameter and these signals became positive during periods of alertness, active whisking, and REM. Blinking was associated with increases in arousal and decreases in blood volume when the mouse was asleep. Bilateral coherence in gamma-band power and in blood volume dropped following awake blinking, indicating a reset of neural and vascular activity. Using only eye metrics (pupil diameter and eye motion), we could determine the arousal state of the mouse ('Awake,' 'NREM,' 'REM') with >90% accuracy with a 5 s resolution. There is a strong relationship between pupil diameter and hemodynamics signals in mice, reflecting the pronounced effects of arousal on cerebrovascular dynamics.","Arousal state affects neural activity and vascular dynamics in the cortex, with sleep associated with large changes in the local field potential and increases in cortical blood flow.

We found that VP GABA neurons are excited by reward-predictive cues but not neutral cues and that this response develops over time. We also found that this cue-evoked response predicts reward-seeking behavior and that inhibiting this VP GABA activity during cue presentation decreases reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, we found increased VP GABA calcium activity at the time of expected reward delivery, which occurred even on trials when reward was omitted.

Here, we directly compared the response properties of putative pyramidal neurons (PNs) and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons (FSNs) during spontaneous licking and forelimb movements in male mice. Recordings centered on the face/mouth motor field of the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) revealed that FSNs fire longer than PNs and earlier for licking, but not for forelimb movements. Computational analysis revealed that FSNs carry vastly more information than PNs about the onset of movement. While PNs differently modulate their discharge during distinct motor acts, most FSNs respond with a stereotyped increase in firing rate. Accordingly, the informational redundancy was greater among FSNs than PNs. Finally, optogenetic silencing of a subset of FSNs reduced spontaneous licking movement.

However, this overrepresentation compromises the detection of approaching objects, which is essential for survival. In the present study, we revisited this long-held notion by reanalyzing motion selectivity in area MT of three macaque monkeys (two males, one female) using random-dot stimuli instead of spot stimuli. We found no differences in the number of neurons tuned to centrifugal versus centripetal motion; however, centrifugally tuned neurons showed stronger tuning than centripetally tuned neurons. This was attributed to the heightened suppression of responses in centrifugal neurons to centripetal motion compared with that of centripetal neurons to centrifugal motion. Our modeling implies that this intensified suppression accounts for superior detection performance for weak centripetal motion stimuli. Moreover, through Fisher information analysis, we establish that the population sensitivity to motion direction in peripheral vision corresponds well with retinal motion statistics during forward locomotion. While these results challenge established concepts, considering the interplay of logarithmic Gaussian receptive fields and spot stimuli can shed light on the previously documented overrepresentation of centrifugal motion. Significantly, our findings reconcile a previously found discrepancy between MT activity and human behavior, highlighting the proficiency of peripheral MT neurons in encoding motion direction efficiently.","The overrepresentation of centrifugal motion in the middle temporal visual area (area MT) has long been thought to provide an efficient coding strategy for optic flow processing.

Human data included slowly-adapting Type-II (SA-II) afferents, which are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5–7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 human subjects (19 females). Torques were superimposed on a 2, 3, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary recordings were made from fast-adapting Type-I (FA-I, n = 39), and slowly-adapting Type-I (SA-I, n = 31) and Type-II (SA-II, n = 13) afferents supplying the fingerpads via microelectrodes inserted into the median nerve. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with torque sensitivity being higher with smaller normal forces. SA-I afferent responses to static torque were inferior to dynamic stimuli in humans In humans this might be compensated by the addition of sustained SA-II afferent input, and their capacity to increase or decrease firing rates with direction of rotation. We conclude that the discrimination capacity of individual afferents of each type was inferior in humans than monkeys which could be because of differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction.","Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces.

Studies in transgenic mice and humans with sex chromosome trisomy (SCT) have revealed direct SCD effects on regional mammalian brain anatomy, but we lack a formal test for cross-species conservation of these effects. Here, we develop a harmonized framework for comparative structural neuroimaging and apply this to systematically profile SCD effects on regional brain anatomy in both humans and mice by contrasting groups with SCT (XXY and XYY) versus XY controls. Total brain size was substantially altered by SCT in humans (significantly decreased by XXY and increased by XYY), but not in mice. Robust and spatially convergent effects of XXY and XYY on regional brain volume were observed in humans, but not mice, when controlling for global volume differences. However, mice do show subtle effects of XXY and XYY on regional volume, although there is not a general spatial convergence in these effects within mice or between species.

But how stress affects brain circuitry dynamically to modulate memory is far less understood. Here, we used male C57BL6/J mice in an auditory fear conditioning as a model system to examine this question and focused on the impact of stress on dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neurons which play an important role in probabilistic fear memory. We found that paraventricular thalamus (PVT) neurons are robustly activated by acute restraining stress. Elevated PVT activity during probabilistic fear memory expression increases spiking in the dmPFC somatostatin neurons which in turn suppresses spiking of dmPFC parvalbumin (PV) neurons, and reverts the usual low fear responses associated with probabilistic fear memory to high fear. This dynamic and reversible modulation allows the original memory to be preserved and modulated during memory expression. In contrast, elevated PVT activity during fear conditioning impairs synaptic modifications in the dmPFC PV-neurons and abolishes the formation of probabilistic fear memory. Thus, PVT functions as a stress sensor to modulate the formation and expression of aversive memory by tuning inhibitory functions in the prefrontal circuitry.","The impact of stress on the formation and expression of memory is well studied, especially on the contributions of stress hormones.

Approaches for inducing plasticity in subcortical motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, could help to boost recovery after damage (e.g., stroke). In this study, we paired loud acoustic stimulation (LAS) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex in male and female healthy humans. LAS activates the reticular formation; TMS activates descending systems, including corticoreticular fibers. Two hundred paired stimuli were used, with 50 ms interstimulus interval at which LAS suppresses TMS responses. Before and after stimulus pairing, responses in the contralateral biceps muscle to TMS alone were measured. Ten, 20, and 30 min after stimulus pairing ended, TMS responses were enhanced, indicating the induction of LTP. No long-term changes were seen in control experiments which used 200 unpaired TMS or LAS, indicating the importance of associative stimulation. Following paired stimulation, no changes were seen in responses to direct corticospinal stimulation at the level of the medulla, or in the extent of reaction time shortening by a loud sound (StartReact effect), suggesting that plasticity did not occur in corticospinal or reticulospinal synapses. Direct measurements in female monkeys undergoing a similar paired protocol revealed no enhancement of corticospinal volleys after paired stimulation, suggesting no changes occurred in intracortical connections. The most likely substrate for the plastic changes, consistent with all our measurements, is an increase in the efficacy of corticoreticular connections. This new protocol may find utility, as it seems to target different motor circuits compared with other available paradigms.","Most current methods for neuromodulation target the cortex.

We find that PKCδ is activated downstream of TrkB and DAG production, and that the spatiotemporal nature of its activation depends on the plasticity stimulation. In response to single-spine plasticity, PKCδ is activated primarily in the stimulated spine and is required for local expression of plasticity. However, in response to multispine stimulation, a long-lasting and spreading activation of PKCδ scales with the number of spines stimulated and, by regulating cAMP response-element binding protein activity, couples spine plasticity to transcription in the nucleus. Thus, PKCδ plays a dual functional role in facilitating synaptic plasticity.","The activity-dependent plasticity of synapses is believed to be the cellular basis of learning.

However, the postnatal origins of the genetic topography of CT and SA remain unclear, given the dramatic cortical development from neonates to adults. To fill this critical gap, this study unprecedentedly explored how genetic information differentially regulates the spatial topography of CT and SA in the neonatal brain by leveraging brain MR images from 202 twin neonates with minimal influence by the complicated postnatal environmental factors. We capitalized on infant-dedicated computational tools and a data-driven spectral clustering method to parcellate the cerebral cortex into a set of distinct regions purely according to the genetic correlation of cortical vertices in terms of CT and SA, respectively, and accordingly created the first genetically informed cortical parcellation maps of neonatal brains. Both genetic parcellation maps exhibit bilaterally symmetric and hierarchical patterns, but distinct spatial layouts. For CT, regions with closer genetic relationships demonstrate an anterior-posterior division, while for SA, regions with greater genetic proximity are typically within the same lobe. Certain genetically informed regions exhibit strong similarities between neonates and adults, with the most striking similarities in the medial surface in terms of SA, despite their overall substantial differences in genetic parcellation maps. These results greatly advance our understanding of the development of genetic influences on the spatial patterning of cortical morphology.","Adult twin neuroimaging studies have revealed that cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) are differentially influenced by genetic information, leading to their spatially distinct genetic patterning and topography.

We demonstrated previously that the γ-Pcdh-C3 isoform (γC3), via its unique “variable” cytoplasmic domain (VCD), interacts in cultured cells with Axin1, a Wnt-pathway scaffold protein that regulates the differentiation and morphology of neurons. Here, we confirm that γC3 and Axin1 interact in the cortex in vivo and show that both male and female mice specifically lacking γC3 exhibit disrupted Axin1 localization to synaptic fractions, without obvious changes in dendritic spine density or morphology. However, both male and female γC3 knock-out mice exhibit severely decreased dendritic complexity of cortical pyramidal neurons that is not observed in mouse lines lacking several other γ-Pcdh isoforms.

Although long-term episodic firing patterns of GnRH neurons in brain slices resemble the pulsatile release of GnRH and LH in vivo, neither the relationship between GnRH neuron firing and release nor if this relationship is influenced by gonadal feedback are known. We combined fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and patch-clamp to perform simultaneous measurements of neuropeptide release with either spontaneous action potential firing, or in response to neuromodulator or action potential spike templates in brain slice preparations from male mice. GnRH release increased with higher frequency spontaneous firing to a point; release reached a plateau after which further increases in firing rate did not elicit further increased release. Kisspeptin, a potent GnRH neuron activator via a Gq-coupled signaling pathway, triggered GnRH release before increasing firing rate, whether globally perfused or locally applied. Increasing the number of spikes in an applied burst template increased release; orchidectomized mice had higher sensitivity to the increased action potential number than sham-operated mice. Similarly, Ca2+ currents triggered by these burst templates were increased in GnRH neurons of orchidectomized mice. These results suggest removal of gonadal feedback increases the efficacy of stimulus-secretion coupling mechanisms, a phenomenon that may extend to other steroid-sensitive regions of the brain.","In vertebrates, the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from neurons in the hypothalamus triggers secretion of anterior pituitary gonadotropins, which activate steroidogenesis, and steroids in turn exert typically homeostatic negative feedback on GnRH release.

In this work, we systematically examined the distinct dominant electrophysiological features for four unique IN subtypes in L1 that were previously identified from mice of either gender: Canopy cells show an irregular firing pattern near rheobase; neurogliaform cells are late-spiking, and their firing rate accelerates during current injections; cells with strong expression of the α7 nicotinic receptor (α7 cells), display onset (rebound) bursting; vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells exhibit high input resistance, strong adaptation, and irregular firing. Computational modeling revealed that these diverse neurophysiological features could be explained by an extended exponential-integrate-and-fire neuron model with varying contributions of a slowly inactivating K+ channel, a T-type Ca2+ channel, and a spike-triggered Ca2+-dependent K+ channel. In particular, we show that irregular firing results from square-wave bursting through a fast-slow analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that irregular firing is frequently observed in VIP cells because of the interaction between strong adaptation and a slowly inactivating K+ channel.

In contrast, silencing Npas1+ GPe neurons with Archaerhodopsin had insignificant effects on Npas1– neuron firing. Blocking spontaneous GABAergic synaptic input with gabazine reproduced the effects of silencing PV+ neuron firing on the firing rate and regularity of Npas1+ neurons and had similar effects on PV+ neuron firing. To simulate the barrage, we constructed conductance waveforms for dynamic clamp based on experimentally measured inhibitory postsynaptic conductance trains from 1 or 2 unitary local connections. The resulting inhibition replicated the effect on firing seen in the intact active network in the slice. We then increased the number of unitary inputs to match estimates of local network connectivity in vivo. As few as 5 unitary inputs produced large increases in firing irregularity. The firing rate was also reduced initially, but PV+ neurons exhibited a slow spike-frequency adaptation that partially restored the rate despite sustained inhibition.

APP deficiency altered excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses, which was accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic APP deletion through the local injection of Cre-expressing adeno-associated viruses in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures [[increased, decreased]] the neurotransmission efficacy at perforant path synapses. In summary, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses that may be [[adversely, beneficially]] affected under altered APP processing conditions."

Here we found that both focal and generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs) in epilepsy patients caused a prolonged decrease in the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR; a measure of respiratory CO2 chemoreception). We then studied Scn1aR1407X/+ (Dravet syndrome; DS) and Scn8aN1768D/+ (D/+) mice of both sexes, two models of SUDEP, and found that convulsive seizures caused a postictal decrease in ventilation and severely depressed the HCVR in a subset of animals. Those mice with severe postictal depression of the HCVR also exhibited transient postictal hypothermia. A combination of blunted HCVR and abnormal thermoregulation is known to occur with dysfunction of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system in mice. Depleting 5-HT with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) mimicked seizure-induced hypoventilation, partially occluded the postictal decrease in the HCVR, exacerbated hypothermia, and increased postictal mortality in DS mice. Conversely, pretreatment with the 5-HT agonist fenfluramine reduced postictal inhibition of the HCVR and hypothermia. These results are consistent with the previous observation that seizures cause transient impairment of serotonergic neuron function, which would be expected to inhibit the many aspects of respiratory control dependent on 5-HT, including baseline ventilation and the HCVR. These results provide a scientific rationale to investigate the interictal and/or postictal HCVR as noninvasive biomarkers for those at high risk of seizure-induced death, and to prevent SUDEP by enhancing postictal 5-HT tone.","Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been linked to respiratory dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.

Here, we characterize the following three distinct forms of ethanol tolerance in male Drosophila: rapid, chronic, and repeated. Rapid tolerance is composed of two short-lived memory-like states, one that is labile and one that is consolidated. Chronic tolerance, induced by continuous exposure, lasts for 2 d, induces ethanol preference, and hinders the development of rapid tolerance through the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Unlike rapid tolerance, chronic tolerance is independent of the immediate early gene Hr38/Nr4a. Chronic tolerance is suppressed by the sirtuin HDAC Sirt1, whereas rapid tolerance is enhanced by Sirt1. Moreover, rapid and chronic tolerance map to anatomically distinct regions of the mushroom body learning and memory centers. Chronic tolerance, like long-term memory, is dependent on new protein synthesis and it induces the kayak/c-fos immediate early gene, but it depends on CREB signaling outside the mushroom bodies, and it does not require the Radish GTPase. Thus, chronic ethanol exposure creates an ethanol-specific memory-like state that is molecularly and anatomically different from other forms of ethanol tolerance.","Ethanol tolerance is the first type of behavioral plasticity and neural plasticity that is induced by ethanol intake, and yet its molecular and circuit bases remain largely unexplored.

The neuronal, but not astrocytic or microglial, Hrs-depleted mice showed a shortened survival and an acceleration in synaptic derangements, including an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, deregulation of phosphorylated AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and profoundly altered synaptic structure, all of which occurred later in the prion-infected control mice. Finally, we found that neuronal Hrs (nHrs) depletion increased surface levels of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, which may contribute to the rapidly advancing disease through neurotoxic signaling. Taken together, the reduced Hrs in the prion-affected brain hampers ubiquitinated protein clearance at the synapse, exacerbates postsynaptic glutamate receptor deregulation, and accelerates neurodegeneration.","Endolysosomal defects in neurons are central to the pathogenesis of prion and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Reactive nitroxidative species, including NO and peroxynitrite (PN), have been implicated in nociceptive sensitization, and neutralizing PN is antinociceptive. We determined whether PN contributes to nociceptive responses in two distinct models of migraine headache. Female and male mice were subjected to 3 consecutive days of restraint stress or to dural stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Following resolution of the initial poststimulus behavioral responses, animals were tested for hyperalgesic priming using a normally non-noxious dose of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or dural pH 7.0, respectively. We measured periorbital von Frey and grimace responses in both models and measured stress-induced changes in 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) expression (a marker for PN activity) and trigeminal ganglia (TGs) mitochondrial function. Additionally, we recorded the neuronal activity of TGs in response to the PN generator SIN-1 [5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)−1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride]. We then tested the effects of the PN decomposition catalysts Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrin (FeTMPyP) and FeTPPS [Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato chloride], or the PN scavenger MnTBAP [Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin] against these behavioral, molecular, and neuronal changes. Neutralizing PN attenuated stress-induced periorbital hypersensitivity and priming to SNP, with no effect on priming to dural pH 7.0. These compounds also prevented stress-induced increases in 3-NT expression in both the TGs and dura mater, and attenuated TG neuronal hyperexcitability caused by SIN-1. Surprisingly, FeTMPyP attenuated changes in TG mitochondrial function caused by SNP in stressed males only. Together, these data strongly implicate PN in migraine mechanisms and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting PN.","Administration of a nitric oxide (NO) donor triggers migraine attacks, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown.

We used a stop-signal fMRI task designed to meet recent consensus guidelines in mapping inhibitory control in 41 iHUDs and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite group similarities in the stop-signal response time (SSRT; the classic inhibitory control measure), compared with HCs, iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity (proportion of hits in go vs false alarms in stop trials; p = 0.003). Additionally, iHUDs exhibited lower right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity during successful versus failed stops (the hallmark inhibitory control contrast). Lower left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with slower SSRT specifically in iHUDs and lower left aPFC activity with worse target sensitivity across all participants (p < 0.05 corrected). Importantly, in iHUDs, lower left SMA and aPFC activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last use and higher severity of dependence, respectively (p < 0.05 corrected). Together, results revealed lower perceptual sensitivity and hypoactivations during inhibitory control in cognitive control regions (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) as associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures in iHUDs. Such neurobehavioral inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction, constituting targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery.","Heroin addiction imposes a devastating toll on society, with little known about its neurobiology.

We show that α-synuclein binds directly to β-spectrin. Using males and females in a Drosophila model of α-synuclein-related disorders, we demonstrate that β-spectrin is critical for α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Further, the ankyrin binding domain of β-spectrin is required for α-synuclein binding and neurotoxicity.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1945-22.2023,Neurobiology of Disease,"Synaptic loss is intrinsically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and symptoms, but its direct impact on clinical symptoms remains elusive. The postsynaptic protein Shank3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains) is of particular interest, as the loss of a single allele of the SHANK3 gene is sufficient to cause profound cognitive symptoms in children. We thus sought to determine whether a SHANK3 deficiency could contribute to the emergence or worsening of AD symptoms and neuropathology. We first found a 30%-50% postmortem loss of SHANK3a associated with cognitive decline in the parietal cortex of individuals with AD. To further probe the role of SHANK3 in AD, we crossed male and female 3xTg-AD mice modelling Aβ and tau pathologies with Shank3a-deficient mice (Shank3Δex4-9). We observed synergistic deleterious effects of Shank3a deficiency and AD neuropathology on object recognition memory at 9, 12, and 18 months of age and on anxious behavior at 9 and 12 months of age in hemizygous Shank3Δex4-9-3xTg-AD mice. In addition to the expected 50% loss of Shank3a, levels of other synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, drebrin, and homer1, remained unchanged in the parietotemporal cortex of hemizygous Shank3Δex4-9 animals. However, Shank3a deficiency increased the levels of soluble Aβ42 and human tau at 18 months of age compared with 3xTg-AD mice with normal Shank3 expression. The results of this study in human brain samples and in transgenic mice are consistent with the hypothesis that Shank3 deficiency makes a key contribution to cognitive impairment in AD.","Synaptic loss is intrinsically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and symptoms, but its direct impact on clinical symptoms remains elusive.

However, the circuit mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. In mice, a decrease of SynGAP levels results in cognitive deficits by interfering with the development of excitatory glutamatergic connections. Recent evidence suggests that SynGAP also plays a crucial role in the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the expression of SYNGAP1 in inhibitory interneurons contributes to cortical circuit function and related behaviors. The activity of cortical neurons has not been measured simultaneously with behavior. To address these gaps, we recorded from layer 2/3 neurons in the primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) of mice while they learned to perform a whisker tactile detection task. Our results demonstrate that mice with interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency exhibit learning deficits characterized by heightened behavioral responses in the absence of relevant sensory input and premature responses to unrelated sensory stimuli not associated with reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by specific circuit abnormalities within wS1. Interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency increases detrimental neuronal correlations directly related to task performance and enhances responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli unrelated to the reward acquisition. In summary, our findings indicate that a reduction of SynGAP in inhibitory interneurons impairs sensory representation in the primary sensory cortex by disrupting neuronal correlations, which likely contributes to the observed cognitive deficits in mice with pan-neuronal SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.","SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans leads to severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and sensory processing deficits.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0368-23.2023,Neurobiology of Disease,"Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a key pathophysiological event that underlies visual and sensory auras in migraine. CSD is also thought to drive the headache phase in migraine by promoting the activation and mechanical sensitization of trigeminal primary afferent nociceptive neurons that innervate the cranial meninges. The factors underlying meningeal nociception in the wake of CSD remain poorly understood but potentially involve the parenchymal release of algesic mediators and damage-associated molecular patterns, particularly ATP. Here, we explored the role of ATP-P2X purinergic receptor signaling in mediating CSD-evoked meningeal afferent activation and mechanical sensitization. Male rats were subjected to a single CSD episode. In vivo, extracellular single-unit recording was used to measure meningeal afferent ongoing activity changes. Quantitative mechanical stimuli using a servomotor force-controlled stimulator assessed changes in the afferent's mechanosensitivity. Manipulation of meningeal P2X receptors was achieved via local administration of pharmacological agents. Broad-spectrum P2X receptor inhibition, selective blockade of the P2X7 receptor, and its related Pannexin 1 channel suppressed CSD-evoked afferent mechanical sensitization but did not affect the accompanying afferent activation response. Surprisingly, inhibition of the pronociceptive P2X2/3 receptor did not affect the activation or sensitization of meningeal afferents post-CSD. P2X7 signaling underlying afferent mechanosensitization was localized to the meninges and did not affect CSD susceptibility. We propose that meningeal P2X7 and Pannexin 1 signaling, potentially in meningeal macrophages or neutrophils, mediates the mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents, which contributes to migraine pain by exacerbating the headache during normally innocuous physical activities.","Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a key pathophysiological event that underlies visual and sensory auras in migraine.

Basic patterns of mesoscale brain activity outside of seizures and IEDs are also frequently disrupted in the epileptic brain and likely influence disease symptoms, but are poorly understood. We aimed to quantify how interictal brain activity differs from that in healthy individuals, and identify what features of interictal activity influence seizure occurrence in a genetic mouse model of childhood epilepsy. Neural activity across the majority of the dorsal cortex was monitored with widefield Ca2+ imaging in mice of both sexes expressing a human Kcnt1 variant (Kcnt1m/m) and wild-type controls (WT). Ca2+ signals during seizures and interictal periods were classified according to their spatiotemporal features. We identified 52 spontaneous seizures, which emerged and propagated within a consistent set of susceptible cortical areas, and were predicted by a concentration of total cortical activity within the emergence zone. Outside of seizures and IEDs, similar events were detected in Kcnt1m/m and WT mice, suggesting that the spatial structure of interictal activity is similar. However, the rate of events whose spatial profile overlapped with where seizures and IEDs emerged was increased, and the characteristic global intensity of cortical activity in individual Kcnt1m/m mice predicted their epileptic activity burden. This suggests that cortical areas with excessive interictal activity are vulnerable to seizures, but epilepsy is not an inevitable outcome. Global scaling of the intensity of cortical activity below levels found in the healthy brain may provide a natural mechanism of seizure protection.","The epileptic brain is distinguished by spontaneous seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs).
